# Monster Templates  

Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a unique creature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from parents of different species. Other templates represent a thing that can happen to a creature, like becoming a ghost.   

A template usually turns a standard monster into an elite monster. Applying an elite template to a monster that is already an elite turns it into a boss monster.   

## Standard Bonuses  

If you apply a template to a monster, it gets the following standard bonuses depending on whether it ends up as an elite or as a boss:  

### Elites  

**From Standard to Elite:**  

* x2 HP  
* +2 bonus on saving throws  
* 1 Action Point per encounter  
* x2 XP  
  
### Bosses  

**From Standard to Boss (two templates applied):**  

* x4 HP  
* +5 bonus on saving throws  
* 2 Action Points per encounter  
* x5 XP  
  

**From Elite to Boss:**  

* x2 HP  
* +5 bonus on saving throws total (doesn’t stack)  
* +1 Action Point per encounter  
* x2.5 XP  
  
## Ghost  
**Speed:** fly 6 (hover).  
**Incorporeal:** The ghost takes half damage from all attacks; see *vulnerable*.  
**Vulnerable:** radiant damage 10, force damage 10. If it takes radiant or force damage, the ghost loses incorporeal until the start of its next turn.

While adjacent to a creature that is staggered or dying, the ghost gains regeneration 5 (10 at Level 11, 15 at Level 21).   

🏹 **Malevolence** (standard, refresh 5, 6) ● Psychic  
Ranged 5, 1 target; Level +2 vs Will; target is controlled (save ends). The ghost is removed from play until the target succeeds on their save, then the ghost is placed in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target.

**Dark Challenge**

## Adventurer  

You can apply a character class to a monster using the simple Adventurer template below.   

As with other templates, the move from standard to elite also doubles a creature’s HP, gives them a saving throw bonus and an additional action point.   

**Defenses:** As per the class.   

**Trained Skills:** Choose two from the class skills.   

**Class Features:** As per the class.  

**Powers:** Choose from those powers available to the class, of the creature’s level or lower. Do not choose two powers of the same frequency *and* level (e.g., do not choose two level 13 encounter powers or two level 25 daily powers).   

* One at-will power.   
* One encounter power (two from level 11).   
* One daily power (two from level 21).   
* One utility power (two from level 11, three from level 21).

# Barghests  

Barghests are wolf-goblin demons.

**Transformation:** If a barghest has fed on 10 or more humanoids, then the next full moon it reforms as a greater barghest. This is a good opportunity for the heroes to face the barghest in a weaker form, get a sense of its powers and tactics before it flees, and then a few days later face a more challenging greater barghest.

# Ichor-Ghouls  

Hundreds of years ago, a secret organization in pursuit of power made the mistake of combining two powerful magical items: an *orb of chaos* and the mysterious *necrosis cube*. The result was the creation of the terrifying undead ichor-ghouls.

Ichor-ghouls that go too long without feeding shrivel and become moribund. Their blood-drenched flesh dries, and they become desiccated husks. The husks' desperate and unquenched need for living energy drives them first to madness and then to near-mindlessness.

Living creatures too near an ichor-ghoul start sweating blood and their skin becomes coated with a scarlet sheen. Blood flows towards the ichor-ghouls, which grow in strength as they absorb it.

When one of the desiccated husks transforms into bloody bones, the husk’s dry skin cracks open and the bloody bones literally tear themselves out of their own body. The thing which emerges is a glistening mass of raw muscle, pulsing with thick veins of crimson-black blood. Its fang-like teeth glitter as its mouth parts in a ghastly, hissing smile.

*This creature appears as a skeletal humanoid with bits of muscle and sinew hanging from its body. Four long, sinewy tendrils writhe from its midsection. The entire creature constantly oozes a mixture of blood and mucus. Its eye sockets are hollow and show no pupils.*

##### Special

Heroes can either encounter a bloody bones after it emerges from a dessicated husk, or encounter the bloody bones in that form - if it has already achieved its reformation through feeding on the blood of other creatures before the heroes arrived on the scene.  

# Infected  

The Infected come about because of a disease, which creates lesions, warts, and boils on the skin as well as causing inflammation within the brain. Those infected think only of eating and destroying. The disease is extremely infectious and can render the target violently ill for days or weeks, bringing them near the point of death, but most of those infected make a full recovery - if they are given time.

The behemoth has had their body and muscles expand until they reach a massive size. The behemoth will use debris throw (if no debris is readily to hand, it will rip up a chunk of tarmac or a large rock) to knock down opponents and run up to fallen targets to use hulk rend.  

# Invaders  

The Invaders represent an alien invasion. This mixing of genres will not suite all fantasy campaigns, but it has been a part of the hobby since the very beginning. The Invaders may be merely an exploratory force, or a misdirected unit intended for a fight on another planet, or the full force of an interstellar armada. In any case, the creatures outlined here represent bodies (also called "shells") cobbled together by the aliens from supplies on their spaceship and whatever materials - inorganic and otherwise - that they find. 

The invasion force consists of “skinner” shock troops and “widows”, which provide command and control. Mobile artillery units are called “chanks” and the flying vehicles are “screamers”. There are also rarely seen larger “beast” mobile strongpoints.

The Invaders have basic intelligence and, with the help of a widow, can coordinate their actions and formulate tactics. However, their overarching strategy of the entire force depends on the “Tri-Pod”—the alien commander.

The punk is a larger infantry support unit with four legs, capable of laying down heavy fire against single or multiple targets. What’s left of its organic head has been supplanted with considerable tracking equipment to pinpoint distant targets. The punk is also often seen an anti-aircraft weapon. It is often flanked by at least a half-dozen skinners.

> Far burst 1 within 5 and 120; +19 vs Reflex; The target is pushed 4 squares. If the target cannot be pushed 4 squares, it takes 2d8+8 damage. Buildings, objects, non-moving vehicles, and terrain take 40 points of damage.  
> **Secured Position**

This unfortunately nicknamed cybernetic mobile artillery unit is only seen coupled with larger units. It has few organic components in its assembly, mostly consisting of recoil absorption hardware and armament. As the chank has no close combat capacity, it depends on its guards to protect it.

> Shift 2 squares.  

Screamer is an umbrella term for one-manned aircraft operated by the shells. Both are considered attack vehicles as neither can be used as a transport. The smaller screamer is used in close quarters as a high-ground support platform for ground based infantry shells while the larger one is an anti-vehicle / crowd disposal device. The only organic compound used in the screamer is a brain (the baby often sports an exposed human skull).

Also known as a conversion unit, the beast is a mobile command node that expands the Invaders' influence and sphere of control. Although capable of combat, the beast prefers to remain back, while constructing more Invaders. While fixed and defended facilities produce larger units like screamers and punks, beasts expand though uncontrolled and populated areas producing ground units as fast as they can acquire raw materials. To destroy one is to cripple the enemy advancement in that area. Unfortunately, beasts are incredibly difficult to defeat. Unlike many Invaders, the beast, although cybernetic, has no visible human features.

The widow is an advanced skinner that has the capacity to influence if not outright control the skinners around it. The widow has very few organic components, sometimes as little as 2%. It also doesn’t always completely follow the humanoid form. Some have synthetic tentacles while others have multiple legs. Individual units have been nicknamed “scorpion,” ”centaur, ” “tarantula,” and “octopus".

# Jiang-Shi  

Jiang-shi are hopping vampires.

##### In the World

**Distractable:** The jiang-shi is compelled to count any heap of things it comes across, like a pile of glutinous rice or a basket of hen eggs. It must spend at least one move action per round counting until it has finished (it is a very fast counter, but there can be a lot of rice in a pile). It cannot use its *special scroll* or *drink breath* powers while distracted. 

**One More Breath:** When a jiang-shi is reduced to 0 HP or below, they fall unconscious and awaken in 1 hour with full hit points. The jiang-shi must then focus for 1 minute to fully return from the Beyond. If it fails to do so (for example, because it is counting hen eggs), it is destroyed. 

**Weaknesses:** Creatures can use a mirror or ringing bell to *repel* a jiang-shi, or an altar heaped with edible offerings to the spirits to *lure* a jiang-shi (see Advanced Combat). 

**Transformation:** If a jiang-shi scholar has drunk the breath of 10 or more humanoids, then the next time it is reduced to 0 HP, it reforms as a jiang-shi magistrate. This is a good opportunity for the heroes to face the jiang-shi in a weaker form, get a sense of its powers and tactics to defeat it, and then a few days later face a more challenging jiang-shi magistrate.

Grynlocs are seven-foot tall, lanky hairless humanoids with legs that bend backwards, like a horse's. Their long, toothy mouths make them look a little like camels. They are nomadic desert-dwellers who can literally see magic instead of light when they lower a special lid across their eyes. 

Their ability to shape magic allows them to write messages invisible to the naked eye and craft beautiful raiments of pure magic that require special sight or a *detect magic* invocation to see.

# Ophiduans  

The ophiduan are an ancient race of serpentine humanoids, whom legend states have walked the earth since before the rise of mammals.

Their cities stand in the midst of thick forests, wild jungles, hidden mountain passes, and anywhere else they can hide from the eyes of humanity. Should anyone draw near enough to see, however, the high walls and sweeping arches of their temples are unmistakable. As befits a race of snake-like creatures, their architecture favors tight spaces, ramps or shallow steps, and rooms built with floors and ledges at various heights. Their tools and weapons are similarly built, favoring flexibility and speed over brute
force.

This creature appears as a somehow pathetic cross of man and snake. A vaguely humanoid torso, covered in reptilian scales, melds into an enormous serpentine tail at the waist. A gaunt humanoid face, also covered in scales, bulges in odd spots as fangs far too large for the mouth push at the thin lips from within. Sporadic tufts of hair just from the top of the head, giving the creature almost a sickly appearance.

The individual before you might pass for human, were it not for the supple scales that make up her skin. Her eyes are dark and unblinking, her features gaunt, her teeth unusually sharp. A dark shock of hair begins at a widow’s peak at her forehead, and flows down her neck and back.

This creature appears to be a great serpent with humanoid features. A serpentine torso boasts a pair of slender arms, each of which is abnormally long and possessed of two elbow joints. The torso splits into two long, writhing tails. A cobra-like hood flares open behind its head, which boasts an oversized face that — despite its scales and unhinged jaw — appears as much human as snake.  

# Ostovites  

Jealous of the size and skeletons of larger creatures, the strange insects called ostovites use skeletons they find or "create" to build themselves chariots of bone.

##### Special

Ostovites are usually found sheltered in their bone chariots, which they control through elaborate pulleys and levers. The ostovites will intermittently lift their bone chariot’s face masks (often made from hip bones or interlaced ribs) to strike with their mandibles.

> **Shattered Bone**   
> While the bone chariot is staggered, it loses its resistance to all damage 5 and no longer grants *shelter* to the ostovite riding it.  
> **Empty Vessel**   
> If the ostovite riding the bone chariot is ever incapacitated or leaves the bone chariot, the bone chariot cannot take any actions until an ostovite rides it again.

> **Speed Burst** (free, legendary)   
> +9The ghoul worm takes a move action.  
> **Legendary Action**   
> Each round, the ghoul worm can take one legendary action. The action interrupts another creature's turn (if it is an opportunity action, like *horror*) or comes after another creature's turn (if it is a free action, like *speed burst*). Alternatively, it can spend its legendary action just before its turn begins to immediately make a saving throw against one condition it is affected by. The ghoul worm cannot take legendary actions on its turn.  

An ostovite that grows fat and strong on freshly-dead corpses eventually sheds its carapace and emerges as a ghoul worm, which resembles the decaying corpse of a naga or large snake. Ghoul worms often wear a giant skull to complete the illusion that they are an undead serpent. The emergence of a ghoul worm often provokes a schism in ostovite hives, with some in the hive worshipping the ghoul worm and others spurning it out of fear.

> As long as the stygira holds a gemstone, they can see through the gem with darkvision and truesight. The stygira is blind when they are not holding a gem.  

A hooded humanoid that sees only through a crystal it holds in its hand, able to paralyze its prey before carting them off to be rendered down in the vast vats of their subterranean lairs.

##### In the World

**Stone Curse:** Wounds dealt by the stygira’s claws leave the flesh bleached of color and turn the blood that runs from them dark gray. A creature petrified by the stone curse that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving throw to remove the effects of stone curse.

**Oracles:** Stygira know divination magic pertaining to reading omens, clairaudience, reading auras and auguries. 

##### Special

Those stygira with particularly precious gemstones may have different gaze attacks.

*A four-legged creature with two small and graceful arms and a blocky head, the beast’s mustard-yellow hide is spotted with what appears to be precious stones.*

##### Tactics

The bauble beast attacks until it has been given enough valuable items, then it runs away. 

##### In the World

**Forge Jewelry:** The bauble beast creates imitation jewelry within its digestive system. Anyone who dons the imitation jewelry is attacked:
+14 vs Will; the target learns where the fake jewelry was created and is compelled for one hour to collect their valuable belongings and bring them to that location. Removing the imitation jewelry ends the effect immediately, but the target can't take it off voluntarily.

##### Special

The bauble beast introduces a new condition: 

**Overly-generous:** The creature spends up to one move action per round trying to give away an item of value. Unless a particular creature requests a gift and/or requests a particular gift, the gift is chosen randomly and the target is chosen randomly among those that can be reached with a single move.

*This is a brutal giant with insectoid features. Although humanoid in shape, it is covered in a hard chitin. Its eyes are faceted, and its mouth boasts two pairs of mandibles, the lower larger than the upper. It hunches as it walks, its knuckles nearly dragging the floor, and a large tail with a needle-like stinger curls up above its head. A horrific, oppressive stench emanates from the creature; the air around it almost seems to simmer with the fumes.*

> **Teleport** (move, encounter) ● **Teleportation**  
> Teleport up to 6.  

*This horrific being stands as a human, but is clearly nothing of the sort. A dark and tattered robe only partly covers a body that appears to be formed entirely of squirming, writhing tendrils in hues of off-white, corpse-gray, and sickly purples and blues. Lengths of these tendrils hang from its sleeves as hands, while others make up a visage that cannot, in any sense of the word, be called a face. It steps forward with a shambling, yet somehow graceful, gait.*

*An enormous floating eye, apparently ripped raw from the skull of some giant beast, hovers in the air before you. Lengths of optic nerve writhe and thrash behind it like tails, fading away after several feet into thin wisps of white mist. That same white mist is visible in the eye’s dark pupil, as though through a window to some distant world.*

*This insectoid creature might be mistaken for a simple giant centipede, were it not for the circular, moray-like maw, the hard reflective chitin that clicks as it moves, and its complete lack of eyes. Something green and foul-smelling trickles from its mouth.*

# Traps  

Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  

## How to Use Traps

Traps can often spice up a combat encounter. Outside of combat, the party does not face the same time and healing pressures, which means traps can feel a little flat. They can still be used to good effect to heighten tension, consume the party's resources or reward clever thinking by the party. 

The traps are usually generic in describing their trigger, but the following are all good options for a trap that targets the creature that triggered it:

* When a chest or drawer is opened.
* When a door is opened. 
* When a character enters a square, stepping on a pressure plate. 
* When a character crosses a trip wire stretched across several squares. Characters that have noticed a trip wire can usually step over it and avoid triggering the trap. 
* When a character interacts with a corpse, precious item or other interesting object, yanking a trip wire attached to the object.  
* When the wrong answer is inputted to a puzzle, like mosaic tiles that must be pressed in a special sequence. 

Something like a lever or button could be used to activate traps that target an area, rather than the creature that triggered them. 

If you select the same trap multiple times for an encounter, it could reflect multiple charges of the one trap or multiple instances of the trap scattered throughout the battlefield. 

## Traps in Play  

When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.  

### Triggering a Trap  

Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the *glyph of warding* spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.  

### Detecting and Disabling a Trap  

Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap's presence.  

A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to notice it or disable it. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Perception check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Perception score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to pause or disarm it.   

### Adjudicating Traps

In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.  

You should allow a character to discover a trap without making a skill check if something would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.  

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.  

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.  

## Trap Types

There are several varieties of type:

* **One-Off:** These traps trigger once, and must be reset before they will trigger again (or in some cases cannot be reset at all). It would be rare, though not impossible, for a one-off trap to be reset during combat. These traps are usually worth one-quarter the XP of a standard trap of their level. 
* **Hazard:** These traps remain on the battlefield, affecting any creature that comes into contact with them. These traps are usually worth one-half the XP of a standard trap of their level. 
* **Recurring:** These traps activate or at least can be activated once per round, once they are triggered. 

## Trap Roles

* **Shooter:** Multiple attacks or areas of effect.   
* **Assassin:** The trap alternates between triggering and retracting.   
* **Blocker:** The trap serves as an impediment, or punishes movement through a particular area.   
* **Warning:** The trap makes a ruckus or otherwise alerts other enemies. Typically it also has negative effects to those who trigger it.   

## Traps in Encounters  

Traps come with a level and an XP value. Add them to encounters just as you would monsters.

# Afflictions

Afflictions are long term, negative effects that characters can suffer from. A creature experiences the negative effects of the stage of the affliction that they are at, plus all earlier stages of the affliction. A creature that reaches stage 0 of its affliction is cured, and loses the affliction. 

## Transmission

Afflictions like poisons and diseases are usually transmitted in one of the four following ways. Afflictions like curses can, of course, be transmitted in all sorts of other ways. 

### Contact

Merely touching this type of affliction exposes the creature. 

### Ingested

Ingested afflictions are virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something poisoned. A chest or other object can be smeared with contact poison as part of a trap. 

### Inhaled

Inhaled afflictions do not affect those that do not breathe. However, holding one’s breath is ineffective against most inhaled afflictions; they  affect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body as well as the lungs.

### Injury

This affliction must be delivered through a wound. Traps that cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like  sometimes contain injury poisons.

A contact or injury poison applied to a weapon is transmitted to the target the next time an attack with that weapon hits, provided there is such a hit within 5 minutes of application. 

### Curse of Lycanthropy (Curse)  

*Level X (this disease is of the same level as the creature that inflicted it).*  

Lycanthropes are humanoids who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other members of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to have or acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.  

Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease, typically from the bites of lycanthropes.    

**Infection:** One day after a humanoid creature is bitten by a lycanthrope, the creature must succeed on a saving throw or become infected. The creature begins on stage 1.

**Progression:** It takes until the next full moon for lycanthropy's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include heavy hair growth, irritability and a taste for raw meat.  

Each time there is a full moon, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 14 + the level of the disease). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.  

* *Stage 1:* If the infected creature is adjacent to an enemy, the creature cannot willingly move away from that enemy.   
* *Stage 2:* If the infected creature is adjacent to an enemy, the creature cannot willingly move away from that enemy. The infected creature cannot use powers that target allies.   
* *Stage 3:* The infected creature becomes a lycanthrope. They can use the *hybrid shape* power. When under the light of the full moon, they must use *hybrid shape*, and can do so even if it is expended. 

### Sewer Plague (Disease)  

*Level 3*  

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.  

**Infection:** Five minutes after a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a saving throw or become infected. The creature begins at stage 1.

**Progression:** It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The creature begins on stage 1.   

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 16). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.  

* *Stage 1:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries.  
* *Stage 2:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries, cannot heal above its Staggered threshold.   
* *Stage 3:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries and cannot heal by any means.   

### Shadowstuff Toxin (Poison)  

*Level 7*   

**Infection:** A creature that makes contact with or is hit with a weapon coated with shadowstuff toxin is subject to a +10 attack vs Fortitude. If hit, they are afflicted. The creature begins on stage 1.

**Progression:** Each hour the target must make a saving throw.  If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they succeed, they make no further saving throws but stay at their current stage until an antidote is administered.  

* *Stage 1:* Victim's skin and eyes turn grey.  

* *Stage 2:* Shadows cling to the victim; +2 to Stealth.  

* *Stage 3:* Victim can no longer be healed beyond staggered.   

* *Stage 4:* Victim begins to flicker from existence; +2 bonus to AC.   

* *Stage 5:* The character ceases to exist and can only be returned to life by powerful magic.   

**Cost:** 104 gp per dose  

### Cackle Fever (Disease)  

*Level 12*  

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of hysterical laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”  

**Infection:** Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 2 squares of an infected creature in the throes of hysterical laughter (see stage 2) suffers a +16 attack vs Fortitude. On a hit, it is infected with the disease. On a miss, it is immune to the hysterical laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.  

**Progression:** Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature loses one recovery that cannot be restored until the disease is cured. The creature begins on stage 1.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 25). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.   

* *Stage 1:* The creature is prone to giggling and finds it hard to concentrate (-2 penalty on all Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma skill checks).
* *Stage 2:* Any event that causes the infected creature great stress – including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare – forces the creature to make a saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d10 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with hysterical laughter (save ends).   
* *Stage 3:* As stage 2, but the infected creature no longer makes Endure checks that might improve the affliction.  

### Sight Rot (Disease)  

*Level 9*  

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.  

**Infection:** One day after a beast or humanoid drinks water tainted by sight rot, they suffer a +12 attack vs Fortitude. On a hit, they are infected with the disease (beginning on stage 1). 

**Progression:** The creature's vision starts to become blurry.   

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 22). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.   

* *Stage 1:* The creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks.  
* *Stage 2:* The creature suffers a -4 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks.   
* *Stage 3:* The creature is blinded until treated.  

**Treatment:** Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character trained in Nature can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.  

# Terrain

## Pools of Chaos

*Level 3*

Pools of chaos are composed of raw, seething primal chaos. Proximity to a pool of chaos may bring about strange changes over time, while direct contact with the raw chaos is even quicker. 

**Changes to inanimate matter:** While immediate contact with a pit of chaos is instantly transformative, even near proximity to a pit will slowly transform objects and creatures. Objects (or portions of objects) within 20 squares of a pit of chaos have a chance of alteration as follows:

* 50 percent chance on contact, and each round after
* 10 percent chance after the first hour
* 5 percent chance after the first 24 hours
* 5 percent chance after the first month
* 5 percent chance after the first year
* 5 percent chance each year thereafter

These percentage chances are not cumulative.

When something is changed, half the time its material changes and the other half of the time its shape or texture changes. Use the Material Changes and Shape/Texture Changes tables to determine the specific type of change.

Generally these alterations cannot be reversed or repaired except through the use of an art.

**Changes to creatures:** Living creatures suffer a +7 attack vs Fortitude each time the following occurs:

*Contact:*

* On contact, and each round after

*After spending time within 20 squares of a pit of chaos:*

* After the first hour
* After the first 24 hours
* After the first month
* After the first year
* After each year thereafter

On a hit, use the *Physical Changes* table to determine the specific type of change.

Generally these alterations cannot be reversed or repaired except through the use of an incantation.

**Spellcasting near a pool of chaos:** Using incantations or arcane powers within 20 squares of a pit of chaos is a risky proposition. To successfully cast the spell the caster must attempt an Arcana check (DC 10 plus half the level of the power or incantation). If this check fails, roll on the Spellcasting Changes table to determine how the spell’s effect is changed. Some results have multiple entries – choose the first one which applies.

##### Table – Spellcasting Changes

| d%    | Change to the Spell Effect                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-20 | Spell target(s) or those within the area of effect are affected as if they made contact with a pool of chaos. |
| 21-50 | Near and Far spells have a random area within range (and random targets within that area where relevant). Melee and ranged spells choose targets randomly from those within range. Spells with a range of self instead target a random creature within 6 squares. |
| 51-70 | Damage-inflicting spells heal instead of harm. Penalties become bonuses and vice versa. Effects become their opposites, if applicable. |
| 71-85 | Spell energy goes wild, becoming a random spell of the same level, keeping target the same if possible. |
| 86-00 | Spell energy surges uncontrollably, exploding in a Near burst 10. +7 attack vs Reflex; on a hit, 1d12+3 force damage. |
