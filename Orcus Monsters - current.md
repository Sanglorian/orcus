# Monster Templates  

Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a unique creature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from parents of different species. Other templates represent a thing that can happen to a creature, like becoming a ghost.   

A template usually turns a standard monster into an elite monster. Applying an elite template to a monster that is already an elite turns it into a boss monster.   

## Standard Bonuses  

If you apply a template to a monster, it gets the following standard bonuses depending on whether it ends up as an elite or as a boss:  

### Elites  

**From Standard to Elite:**  

* x2 HP  
* +2 bonus on saving throws  
* 1 Action Point per encounter  
* x2 XP  
  
### Bosses  

**From Standard to Boss (two templates applied):**  

* x4 HP  
* +5 bonus on saving throws  
* 2 Action Points per encounter  
* x5 XP  
  

**From Elite to Boss:**  

* x2 HP  
* +5 bonus on saving throws total (doesn‚Äôt stack)  
* +1 Action Point per encounter  
* x2.5 XP  
  
## Ghost  
**Speed:** fly 6 (hover).  
**Incorporeal:** The ghost takes half damage from all attacks; see *vulnerable*.  
**Vulnerable:** radiant damage 10, force damage 10. If it takes radiant or force damage, the ghost loses incorporeal until the start of its next turn.   

**Drain Lifeforce**  
While adjacent to a creature that is staggered or dying, the ghost gains regeneration 5 (10 at Level 11, 15 at Level 21).   

üèπ **Malevolence** (standard, refresh 5, 6) ‚óè Psychic  
Ranged 5, 1 target; Level +2 vs Will; target is controlled (save ends). The ghost is removed from play until the target succeeds on their save, then the ghost is placed in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target. While removed from play, the ghost does not take turns, suffer persistent damage or make saving throws.   

## Half-Fiend  
**Defenses:** +2 Fortitude, +2 Reflex.  
**Senses:** Darkvision.  
**Resist:** acid 5, cold 5, fire 5.

**Shadow Walk** (swift, encounter) ‚óè **Illusion, Teleportation**  
The shade shifts 3 and is invisible until the end of its next turn.  

**Dark Challenge**  
When a shade strikes a target in melee, the target is marked until the end of the shade‚Äôs next turn.  

## Adventurer  

You can apply a character class to a monster using the simple Adventurer template below.   

As with other templates, the move from standard to elite also doubles a creature‚Äôs HP, gives them a saving throw bonus and an additional action point.   

**Defenses:** As per the class.   

**Trained Skills:** Choose two from the class skills.   

**Class Features:** As per the class.  

**Powers:** Choose from those powers available to the class, of the creature‚Äôs level or lower. Do not choose two powers of the same frequency *and* level (do not choose two level 13 encounter powers or two level 25 daily powers, for examp).   

* One at-will power.   
* One encounter power (two from level 11).   
* One daily power (two from level 21).   
* One utility power (two from level 11, three from level 21).  
  

# Monster Traits

Monster traits are like templates, but they do not affect the overall challenge posed by the monster enough that their type or level changes.

**Against the Fallen**  
When an ally is killed, the creature gains a +1 power bonus to its next attack roll.

**Combat Drill** (immediate (react), at-will)  
When an ally moves into or out of an adjacent square; the monster may shift up to three squares as long as it moves in the direction of its ally.

**Dirty Fighter**  
+2 damage against targets granting the creature combat advantage. In addition, all enemies suffer an additional -1 penalty to attack rolls against the creature when it is behind cover or has concealment.

**Encouraging Reaction**  
When the creature scores a critical hit, one ally can make a basic attack as an immediate (react) action.

**Group Confidence**  
If creatures with this trait in the encounter outnumber their opponents by 2-to-1, each such creature gains +2 power bonus to damage rolls.

**Ironclad (mook only)**  
When the mook is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is considered staggered and is set to 1 hit point. If a staggered ironclad mook is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is killed.

**Martyrdom** (immediate (react), encounter)  
When the monster is reduced to 0 hit points of less; all allies in line of sight may shift three squares.

**More Than Expected (mook only)**  
When the mook is eliminated, make a save. On a success, place an identical mook anywhere within ten squares of it that is not in line of sight of a player character. Do not adjust experience.

**Reliable Backup**  
The creature gains a +2 power bonus to AC while adjacent to an ally. 

**Skysea Denizen**  
Replace the creature‚Äôs swim speed with a fly speed. Remove the aquatic keyword, if the creature has it.

**We Are One**  
The creature can sacrifice its move action to give an ally a move action. Creatures cannot receive more than two move actions per round. A creature that has received a move action can replace two move actions with one standard action.

Four pulsating blue-black orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. It uses its tail for propulsion in the water and drags itself along with its tentacles on land. An aboleth weighs about 6,500 pounds.

# Cult of the New Moon  

The church of Shehaan has never shied from acknowledging the goddess' moods and strange humours. She can be wild during the new moon, and takes on a shadowed aspect during the lunar eclipse. Legend has it that Shehaan's shadow self once lasted for decades or centuries, and ruled the earth with darkness and glory. The Cult of the New Moon are a heretic branch of the church of Shehaan that worships what they claim is the true Shehaan, the dark aspect she showed during this period. Whereas the church cautions that lycanthropy is a gift or a curse depending on how it is used, the Cult treats shapechanging as a tool at best and an excuse for cruelty and violence at worst.

Lamias are scorpion, snake or lion-bodied centaurs with human upper bodies. They were once lycanthropes, but after they took control of a kingdom and ruled it with an iron fist Shehaan fixed them in hybrid form. Jealous of the shapeshifting they had lost, they used dark rituals to give themselves back the ability to transform - but the transformation is incomplete, and only allows them to turn into swarms of insects.  

Lamias recruit unwanted children, turning them into lycanthropes - their janissaries. As an incantation, a lamia can remove one of its eyes and either command it roll of its own volition (speed 3) or assign it to a servant to spy. Lamias will bargain to get an eye back.

*This demonic humanoid is squat and bloated, standing nearly three times as tall as a normal human. It goat-like head sports large, spiraling ram-like horns. Its legs are covered in thick brown fur and end in hooves.*  

*Large powerful arms wield a wicked skull-tipped wand. Two large, black, bat-like wings protrude from its back and a long, snake-like tail, tipped with a sharpened barb, trails behind it.*  

Orcus is one of the strongest (if not the strongest) and most powerful of all demon lords. He fights a never-ending war against rival demon princes that spans several Abyssal layers. From his great bone palace he commands his troops as they wage war across the smoldering and stinking planes of the Abyss. Orcus spends most of his days in his palace, rarely leaving its confines unless he decides to leads his troops into battle (which has happened on more than one occasion). Most of the time though, he is content to let his generals and commanders lead the battles.  

When not warring against rival demon princes, Orcus likes to travel the planes, particularly the Material Plane. Should a foolish spellcaster open a gate and speak his name, he is more than likely going to hear the call and step through to the Material Plane. What happens to the spellcaster that called him usually depends on the reason for the summons and the power of the spellcaster. Extremely powerful spellcasters are usually slain after a while and turned into undead soldiers or generals in his armies.

## Ichor-Ghouls  

Hundreds of years ago, a secret organization in pursuit of power made the mistake of combining two powerful magical items: an *orb of chaos* and the mysterious *necrosis cube*. The result was the creation of the terrifying undead ichor-ghouls.

Ichor-ghouls that go too long without feeding shrivel and become moribund. Their blood-drenched flesh dries, and they become desiccated husks. The husks' desperate and unquenched need for living energy drives them first to madness and then to near-mindlessness.

Living creatures too near an ichor-ghoul start sweating blood and their skin becomes coated with a scarlet sheen. Blood flows towards the ichor-ghouls, which grow in strength as they absorb it.

When one of the desiccated husks transforms into bloody bones, the husk‚Äôs dry skin cracks open and the bloody bones literally tear themselves out of their own body. The thing which emerges is a glistening mass of raw muscle, pulsing with thick veins of crimson-black blood. Its fang-like teeth glitter as its mouth parts in a ghastly, hissing smile.

*This creature appears as a skeletal humanoid with bits of muscle and sinew hanging from its body. Four long, sinewy tendrils writhe from its midsection. The entire creature constantly oozes a mixture of blood and mucus. Its eye sockets are hollow and show no pupils.*

##### Special

Heroes can either encounter a bloody bones after it emerges from a dessicated husk, or encounter the bloody bones in that form - if it has already achieved its reformation through feeding on the blood of other creatures before the heroes arrived on the scene.

Maruts confront those who would try to deny the grave itself.

Any who use unnatural means to extend their life span could be targeted by a marut. Those who take extraordinary measures to cheat death in some other way might be labeled transgressors as well. Those who use magic to reverse death aren‚Äôt worthy of a marut‚Äôs attention unless they do so repeatedly or on a massive scale.

When a marut has identified its target, it walks surely and implacably toward the foe, never resting.  

# Infected  

The Infected come about because of a disease, which creates lesions, warts, and boils on the skin as well as causing inflammation within the brain. Those infected think only of eating and destroying. The disease is extremely infectious and can render the target violently ill for days or weeks, bringing them near the point of death, but most of those infected make a full recovery - if they are given time. Infected are also known as "false zombies".

The behemoth has had their body and muscles expand until they reach a massive size. The behemoth will use debris throw (if no debris is readily to hand, it will rip up a chunk of tarmac or a large rock) to knock down opponents and run up to fallen targets to use hulk rend.  

# Invaders  

The Invaders represent an alien invasion. This mixing of genres will not suite all fantasy campaigns, but it has been a part of the hobby since the very beginning. The Invaders may be merely an exploratory force, or a misdirected unit intended for a fight on another planet, or the full force of an interstellar armada. In any case, the creatures outlined here represent bodies (also called "shells") cobbled together by the aliens from supplies on their spaceship and whatever materials - inorganic and otherwise - that they find. 

The invasion force consists of ‚Äúskinner‚Äù shock troops and ‚Äúwidows‚Äù, which provide command and control. Mobile artillery units are called ‚Äúchanks‚Äù and the flying vehicles are ‚Äúscreamers‚Äù. There are also rarely seen larger ‚Äúbeast‚Äù mobile strongpoints.

The Invaders have basic intelligence and, with the help of a widow, can coordinate their actions and formulate tactics. However, their overarching strategy of the entire force depends on the ‚ÄúTri-Pod‚Äù‚Äîthe alien commander.

The punk is a larger infantry support unit with four legs, capable of laying down heavy fire against single or multiple targets. What‚Äôs left of its organic head has been supplanted with considerable tracking equipment to pinpoint distant targets. The punk is also often seen an anti-aircraft weapon. It is often flanked by at least a half-dozen skinners.  


> #### Chank

> **Level 14 Archer** (1000 XP)  
> Large Cosmic Automaton ‚óè Construct (Unaligned)

> ‚§¢	**Self Propelled Plasma Artillery System** (standard and move, at-will) ‚óè **Weapon**  
> Far burst 1 within 5 and 120; +17.0 vs Reflex; 2d8+8 damage, and the target is knocked prone. *Miss:* Half damage.  
> ‚ãá	**Perimeter Blast** (standard and move, refresh 4, 5, 6) ‚óè **Weapon**  
> Far burst 1 within 5 and 120; +17 vs Reflex; The target is pushed 4 squares. If the target cannot be pushed 4 squares, it takes 2d8+8 damage. Buildings, objects, non-moving vehicles, and terrain take 40 points of damage.  
> **Secured Position**   
> As long as there is at least one ally adjacent to the chank, the chank is immune to being immobile, knocked prone, pushed, slowed or marked.  
> **Charge Capacitor** (standard, at-will)   
> Increase the damage of the chank‚Äôs next *self propelled plasma artillery system* attack by 1d8.  
> **Capacitor Purge** (reaction, encounter)   
> The chank is reduced to 0 hit points or below: The chank makes a *perimeter blast* attack.  

This unfortunately nicknamed cybernetic mobile artillery unit is only seen coupled with larger units. It has few organic components in its assembly, mostly consisting of recoil absorption hardware and armament. As the chank has no close combat capacity, it depends on its guards to protect it.  


> #### Mother Screamer

> **AC:** 28; **Fort:** 26, **Ref:** 27, **Will:** 25   
> **HP:** 77, **Staggered:** 38      
>
> ‚§¢	**Pulse Rifle** (standard, at-will) ‚óè **Weapon**  
> Ranged 30/60; +19.0 vs AC; 3d6+12 damage.  
> **Repulsor Shield**   
> The screamer does not provoke opportunity attacks when attacking. The screamer is immune to attacks made from a range of 30 squares or more.  
> **Deploy Support Unit** (move, at-will)   
> Place a screamer baby in an adjacent square. The mother can only have three baby units in the encounter at a time. A baby placed this way acts on the mother‚Äôs initiative and can act immediately after being placed.  
> **Dash** (move, at-will)   
> Shift 2 squares.  

Screamer is an umbrella term for one-manned aircraft operated by the shells. Both are considered attack vehicles as neither can be used as a transport. The smaller screamer is used in close quarters as a high-ground support platform for ground based infantry shells while the larger one is an anti-vehicle / crowd disposal device. The only organic compound used in the screamer is a brain (the baby often sports an exposed human skull).

> ‚Ä°	**Slam** (standard, at-will)   
> +19.0 vs AC; 2d8+15 damage.  
> **Raw Materials**   
> Place six corpses in Near burst 10 around the beast at the start of the encounter.  
> **Gray Infection** (standard, at-will) ‚óè **Weapon**  
> +17 vs Reflex; 2d8+7 damage, and the target suffers persistent 1 damage until the end of the encounter.  
> ‚à¢	**Shoulder-Mounted Plasma Caster** (standard, at-will) ‚óè **Weapon**  
> Near burst 1 (within 20/40); +17 vs Reflex; 2d8+7 damage, and the target takes persistent 5 fire damage (save ends).  
> ‚Üó	**Flesh Hooks** (standard, refresh 5, 6)   
> Ranged 20; +17 vs Reflex; 3d6+13 damage, the target is pulled into an adjacent square, and the beast immediately makes a *gray infection* attack.  
> **Convert** (move, at-will)   
> Target one adjacent corpse or killed creature. The target is replaced with a skinner. A skinner placed this way acts on the beast‚Äôs initiative and can act immediately after being placed.  
> **Nano-Propagation** (swift, at-will)   
> Select one enemy suffering from persistent damage from *gray infection*. Increase the persistent damage by 1.  

Also known as a conversion unit, the beast is a mobile command node that expands the Invaders' influence and sphere of control. Although capable of combat, the beast prefers to remain back, while constructing more Invaders. While fixed and defended facilities produce larger units like screamers and punks, beasts expand though uncontrolled and populated areas producing ground units as fast as they can acquire raw materials. To destroy one is to cripple the enemy advancement in that area. Unfortunately, beasts are incredibly difficult to defeat. Unlike many Invaders, the beast, although cybernetic, has no visible human features.

> **Uplink** (swift, at-will) ‚óè **Stance**  
> When the widow enters this stance it chooses a skinner. On its turn, that skinner can (as a swift action) shift one square and make a basic attack. The widow can select a new skinner as the target of this stance as a swift action.  

The widow is an advanced skinner that has the capacity to influence if not outright control the skinners around it. The widow has very few organic components, sometimes as little as 2%. It also doesn‚Äôt always completely follow the humanoid form. Some have synthetic tentacles while others have multiple legs. Individual units have been nicknamed ‚Äúscorpion,‚Äù ‚Äùcentaur, ‚Äù ‚Äútarantula,‚Äù and ‚Äúoctopus‚Äù.

# Jiang-Shi  

Jiang-shi are hopping vampires.

##### In the World

**Distractable:** The jiang-shi is compelled to count any heap of things it comes across, like a pile of glutinous rice or a basket of hen eggs. It must spend at least one move action per round counting until it has finished (it is a very fast counter, but there can be a lot of rice in a pile). It cannot use its *special scroll* or *drink breath* powers while distracted. 

**One More Breath:** When a jiang-shi is reduced to 0 HP or below, they fall unconscious and awaken in 1 hour with full hit points. The jiang-shi must then focus for 1 minute to fully return from the Beyond. If it fails to do so (for example, because it is counting hen eggs), it is destroyed. 

**Weaknesses:** Creatures can use a mirror or ringing bell to *repel* a jiang-shi, or an altar heaped with edible offerings to the spirits to *lure* a jiang-shi (see Advanced Combat). 

**Transformation:** If a jiang-shi scholar has drunk the breath of 10 or more humanoids, then the next time it is reduced to 0 HP, it reforms as a jiang-shi magistrate. This is a good opportunity for the heroes to face the jiang-shi in a weaker form, get a sense of its powers and tactics to defeat it, and then a few days later face a more challenging jiang-shi magistrate.

Grynlocs are seven-foot tall, lanky hairless humanoids with legs that bend backwards, like a horse's. Their long, toothy mouths make them look a little like camels. They are nomadic desert-dwellers who can literally see magic instead of light when they lower a special lid across their eyes. 

Their ability to shape magic allows them to write messages invisible to the naked eye and craft beautiful raiments of pure magic that require special sight or a *detect magic* invocation to see.

# Ophiduans  

The ophiduan are an ancient race of serpentine humanoids, whom legend states have walked the earth since before the rise of mammals.

Their cities stand in the midst of thick forests, wild jungles, hidden mountain passes, and anywhere else they can hide from the eyes of humanity. Should anyone draw near enough to see, however, the high walls and sweeping arches of their temples are unmistakable. As befits a race of snake-like creatures, their architecture favors tight spaces, ramps or shallow steps, and rooms built with floors and ledges at various heights. Their tools and weapons are similarly built, favoring flexibility and speed over brute
force.

This creature appears as a somehow pathetic cross of man and snake. A vaguely humanoid torso, covered in reptilian scales, melds into an enormous serpentine tail at the waist. A gaunt humanoid face, also covered in scales, bulges in odd spots as fangs far too large for the mouth push at the thin lips from within. Sporadic tufts of hair just from the top of the head, giving the creature almost a sickly appearance.

The individual before you might pass for human, were it not for the supple scales that make up her skin. Her eyes are dark and unblinking, her features gaunt, her teeth unusually sharp. A dark shock of hair begins at a widow‚Äôs peak at her forehead, and flows down her neck and back.

This creature appears to be a great serpent with humanoid features. A serpentine torso boasts a pair of slender arms, each of which is abnormally long and possessed of two elbow joints. The torso splits into two long, writhing tails. A cobra-like hood flares open behind its head, which boasts an oversized face that ‚Äî despite its scales and unhinged jaw ‚Äî appears as much human as snake.  

# Ostovites  

Jealous of the size and skeletons of larger creatures, the strange insects called ostovites use skeletons they find or "create" to build themselves chariots of bone.

##### Special

Ostovites are usually found sheltered in their bone chariots, which they control through elaborate pulleys and levers. The ostovites will intermittently lift their bone chariot‚Äôs face masks (often made from hip bones or interlaced ribs) to strike with their mandibles.

> **Shattered Bone**   
> While the bone chariot is staggered, it loses its resistance to all damage 5 and no longer grants *shelter* to the ostovite riding it.  
> **Empty Vessel**   
> If the ostovite riding the bone chariot is ever incapacitated or leaves the bone chariot, the bone chariot cannot take any actions until an ostovite rides it again.  

Skeletons as assembled by someone with only a passing familiarity with or interest in human anatomy.

##### Game Master tips

The players will likely assume that the ostovite and its chariot are a single creature. Assume they are attacking the chariot unless they specify otherwise. When the ostovite is ready to attack, it lifts the chariot‚Äôs bone mask. At some point, they will tweak that the chariot‚Äôs skittering silver ‚Äútongue‚Äù is an armor-plated insect with a hundred chitinous legs gripping onto the chariot.  

Since a chariot stops working when its ostovite is destroyed, the heroes may start targeting the ostovites with attacks. Some things they may choose include:  

* The default is simply to attack the ostovite through the bone chariot. The ostovite has cover, and gets resistance from the chariot until the chariot is staggered.
* They may pull the chariot‚Äôs mask off to leave the ostovite exposed. Make a Strength check vs Fortitude.
* They may ready an action to attack when the ostovite attacks.
* Any other creative solution will do.

An ostovite that grows fat and strong on freshly-dead corpses eventually sheds its carapace and emerges as a ghoul worm, which resembles the decaying corpse of a naga or large snake. Ghoul worms often wear a giant skull to complete the illusion that they are an undead serpent. The emergence of a ghoul worm often provokes a schism in ostovite hives, with some in the hive worshipping the ghoul worm and others spurning it out of fear.

> **Light Sensitivity**   
> Any time the throach is exposed to bright light, it is rattled (save ends).  

*This hideous, dark blue creature is nearly seven feet long and has a tail like a scorpion, but no pincers.*

The throach has the body and head of a roach, and six roach-like legs, but from the end of the thorax protrudes a scorpion-like tail complete with stinger. The stinger is straighter and more spear-like than the
slightly curved stinger of a scorpion. The throach‚Äôs chitinous shell is iridescent dark blue (indigo or navy), almost black, but shades of purple can be seen in the right light.  

Throaches thrive in moisture-rich environments, and are common in swamps, marshes and wet forests. They can also be found in the sewer systems of many large cities and occasionally inhabit ruins in damp,
rainy regions. Where one throach is found, others are usually located, so even a solitary encounter with one is often indicative of a brood nearby. Throaches prefer to live in dark or shadowy areas, and will scurry from bright light.  

Throaches can be deadly to non-adventurers, or even unprepared adventurers with their bite and sting, but the true danger lies in their reproductive method. Throaches are asexual creatures that both produce and fertilize their own eggs. However, in order for the young to hatch and survive, the eggs must be implanted in a living creature. Typically, a throach will sting a victim, and when the paralyzed victim lies helpless it will implant several eggs inside the abdominal cavity. These eggs hatch in 24 hours and begin feeding on the host, killing it in the process. This provides enough nutrition and energy for the young throaches to scurry for cover and establish a territory.

An ettercap is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their cunning traps often ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does engage its enemies, it attacks with its keen-edged claws and venomous bite. It usually will not come within melee reach of any foe that is still able to move.

A hooded humanoid that sees only through a crystal it holds in its hand, able to paralyze its prey before carting them off to be rendered down in the vast vats of their subterranean lairs.

##### In the World

**Stone Curse:** Wounds dealt by the stygira‚Äôs claws leave the flesh bleached of color and turn the blood that runs from them dark gray. A creature petrified by the stone curse that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving throw to remove the effects of stone curse.

**Oracles:** Stygira know divination magic pertaining to reading omens, clairaudience, reading auras and auguries.

Those stygira with particularly precious gemstones may have different gaze attacks.

*A four-legged creature with two small and graceful arms and a blocky head, the beast‚Äôs mustard-yellow hide is spotted with what appears to be precious stones.*

##### Tactics

The bauble beast attacks until it has been given enough valuable items, then it runs away. 

##### In the World

**Forge Jewelry:** The bauble beast creates imitation jewelry within its digestive system. Anyone who dons the imitation jewelry is attacked:
+14 vs Will; the target learns where the fake jewelry was created and is compelled for one hour to collect their valuable belongings and bring them to that location. Removing the imitation jewelry ends the effect immediately, but the target can't take it off voluntarily.

##### Special

The bauble beast introduces a new condition: 

**Overly-generous:** The creature spends up to one move action per round trying to give away an item of value. Unless a particular creature requests a gift and/or requests a particular gift, the gift is chosen randomly and the target is chosen randomly among those that can be reached with a single move.

*This is a brutal giant with insectoid features. Although humanoid in shape, it is covered in a hard chitin. Its eyes are faceted, and its mouth boasts two pairs of mandibles, the lower larger than the upper. It hunches as it walks, its knuckles nearly dragging the floor, and a large tail with a needle-like stinger curls up above its head. A horrific, oppressive stench emanates from the creature; the air around it almost seems to simmer with the fumes.*

*This horrific being stands as a human, but is clearly nothing of the sort. A dark and tattered robe only partly covers a body that appears to be formed entirely of squirming, writhing tendrils in hues of off-white, corpse-gray, and sickly purples and blues. Lengths of these tendrils hang from its sleeves as hands, while others make up a visage that cannot, in any sense of the word, be called a face. It steps forward with a shambling, yet somehow graceful, gait.*

That same white mist is visible in the eye‚Äôs dark pupil, as though through a window to some distant world.*

* A mote starts flying towards another of its own accord
* A portal opens to the City of Brass or another planar location
* A monster turns into a completely different monster
* All elements on a mote swap (air becomes earth, water becomes fire, and vice versa).  

# Traps  

Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  

## How to Use Traps

Traps can often spice up a combat encounter. Outside of combat, the party does not face the same time and healing pressures, which means traps can feel a little flat. They can still be used to good effect to heighten tension, consume the party's resources or reward clever thinking by the party. 

The traps are usually generic in describing their trigger, but the following are all good options for a trap that targets the creature that triggered it:

* When a chest or drawer is opened.
* When a door is opened. 
* When a character enters a square, stepping on a pressure plate. 
* When a character crosses a trip wire stretched across several squares. Characters that have noticed a trip wire can usually step over it and avoid triggering the trap. 
* When a character interacts with a corpse, precious item or other interesting object, yanking a trip wire attached to the object.  
* When the wrong answer is inputted to a puzzle, like mosaic tiles that must be pressed in a special sequence. 

Something like a lever or button could be used to activate traps that target an area, rather than the creature that triggered them. 

If you select the same trap multiple times for an encounter, it could reflect multiple charges of the one trap or multiple instances of the trap scattered throughout the battlefield. 

## Traps in Play  

When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.  

### Triggering a Trap  

Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the *glyph of warding* spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.  

### Detecting and Disabling a Trap  

Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap's presence.  

A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to notice it or disable it. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Perception check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Perception score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to pause or disarm it.   

### Adjudicating Traps

In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.  

You should allow a character to discover a trap without making a skill check if something would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.  

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.  

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.  

## Trap Types

There are several varieties of type:

* **One-Off:** These traps trigger once, and must be reset before they will trigger again (or in some cases cannot be reset at all). It would be rare, though not impossible, for a one-off trap to be reset during combat. These traps are usually worth one-quarter the XP of a standard trap of their level. 
* **Hazard:** These traps remain on the battlefield, affecting any creature that comes into contact with them. These traps are usually worth one-half the XP of a standard trap of their level. 
* **Recurring:** These traps activate or at least can be activated once per round, once they are triggered. 

## Trap Roles

* **Shooter:** Multiple attacks or areas of effect.   
* **Assassin:** The trap alternates between triggering and retracting.   
* **Blocker:** The trap serves as an impediment, or punishes movement through a particular area.   
* **Warning:** The trap makes a ruckus or otherwise alerts other enemies. Typically it also has negative effects to those who trigger it.   

## Traps in Encounters  

Traps come with a level and an XP value. Add them to encounters just as you would monsters.   

## Sample Traps  

### Cinder Trap  

*One sconce is set up to launch its torch at a distant creature when that creature disturbs the trap's trigger.*  

**Level 1 One-Off Warning** (25 XP Trap)  

Perception DC 12: The character notices the slow-burning torch and the mechanism that flings it.  

**Trigger** The trap attacks when a character comes into contact with the trigger. It must be manually reset before it triggers again.  
**Target** The creature that triggers the trap.  

‚Üó	**Attack** ‚óè **Fire**  
Ranged 5; +4 vs Reflex  
*Hit* 1d6+1 fire damage.  

**Countermeasures** 
An adjacent character can disable the trap with a DC 18 Sleight of Hand check.
If the trap is triggered, an adjacent character can throw himself in front of the trap to prevent the torch from being flung into the air with a successful DC 12 Acrobatics or Athletics check. However, if the character is successful, they suffer 1 point of fire damage.  

### Simple Spear Trap  

*A spear shoots out from a hole near to the trigger of this trap.*  

**Level 1 One-Off Warning** (25 XP Trap)  

Perception DC 12: The character notices the mechanism that fires the spear.  

**Trigger** The trap attacks when a character comes into contact with the trigger. It must be manually reset before it triggers again.  
**Target** The creature that triggers the trap.  

‚Ä†	**Attack**   
+4 vs AC  
*Hit* 1d8+3 damage.  

**Countermeasures** 
An adjacent character can disable the spear trap with a DC 18 Sleight of Hand check.
A DC 12 Dungeoneering check grants the party a +2 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks to delay or disable the trap.

# Afflictions

Afflictions are long term, negative effects that characters can suffer from. A creature experiences the negative effects of the stage of the affliction that they are at, plus all earlier stages of the affliction. A creature that reaches stage 0 of its affliction is cured, and loses the affliction. 

## Transmission

Afflictions like poisons and diseases are usually transmitted in one of the four following ways. Afflictions like curses can, of course, be transmitted in all sorts of other ways. 

### Contact

Merely touching this type of affliction exposes the creature. 

### Ingested

Ingested afflictions are virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something poisoned. A chest or other object can be smeared with contact poison as part of a trap. 

### Inhaled

Inhaled afflictions do not affect those that do not breathe. However, holding one‚Äôs breath is ineffective against most inhaled afflictions; they  affect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body as well as the lungs.

### Injury

This affliction must be delivered through a wound. Traps that cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like  sometimes contain injury poisons.

A contact or injury poison applied to a weapon is transmitted to the target the next time an attack with that weapon hits, provided there is such a hit within 5 minutes of application. 

## Aboleth Slime (Disease)

*Level 10*

Aboleths excrete slime, which makes those exposed to it better suited to the aboleth's underwater caverns.

**Infection:** Immediately upon being exposed to aboleth slime, the creature is infected. 

**Progression:** Each additional exposure to aboleth slime causes an infected creature to get one step worse. Each hour, the infected creature makes a saving throw. On a success, they get one step better. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they only make a saving throw every day. 

* *Stage 1:* The victim loses the ability to breathe air and gains the ability to breathe underwater. 
* *Stage 2:* The victim‚Äôs skin softens, giving them resistance to fire 5 and vulnerability to everything else 5. 
* *Stage 3:* The victim‚Äôs skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane. Every hour this membrane remains dry, the creature loses a recovery. However, the victim does recover the ability to breathe air, if it previously had it. 

## Cackle Fever (Disease)  

*Level 12*  

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of hysterical laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: ‚Äúthe shrieks.‚Äù  

**Infection:** Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 2 squares of an infected creature in the throes of hysterical laughter (see stage 2) suffers a +16 attack vs Fortitude. On a hit, it is infected with the disease. On a miss, it is immune to the hysterical laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.  

**Progression:** Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature loses one recovery that cannot be restored until the disease is cured. The creature begins on stage 1.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 25). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.   

* *Stage 1:* The creature is prone to giggling and finds it hard to concentrate (-2 penalty on all Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma skill checks).
* *Stage 2:* Any event that causes the infected creature great stress ‚Äì including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare ‚Äì forces the creature to make a saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d10 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with hysterical laughter (save ends).   
* *Stage 3:* As stage 2, but the infected creature no longer makes Endure checks that might improve the affliction.  

## Curse of Lycanthropy (Curse)  

*Level X (this disease is of the same level as the creature that inflicted it).*  

Lycanthropes are humanoids who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other members of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to have or acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.  

Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease, typically from the bites of lycanthropes.    

**Infection:** One day after a humanoid creature is bitten by a lycanthrope, the creature must succeed on a saving throw or become infected. The creature begins on stage 1.

**Progression:** It takes until the next full moon for lycanthropy's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include heavy hair growth, irritability and a taste for raw meat.  

Each time there is a full moon, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 14 + the level of the disease). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.  

* *Stage 1:* If the infected creature is adjacent to an enemy, the creature cannot willingly move away from that enemy.   
* *Stage 2:* If the infected creature is adjacent to an enemy, the creature cannot willingly move away from that enemy. The infected creature cannot use powers that target allies.   
* *Stage 3:* The infected creature becomes a lycanthrope. They gain the relevant *form of the X* power. When under the light of the full moon, they must use the *form of the X* power, and can do so even if it is expended. 

## Sewer Plague (Disease)  

*Level 3*  

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.  

**Infection:** Five minutes after a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a saving throw or become infected. The creature begins at stage 1.

**Progression:** It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The creature begins on stage 1.   

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 16). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.  

* *Stage 1:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries.  
* *Stage 2:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries, cannot heal above its Staggered threshold.   
* *Stage 3:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries and cannot heal by any means.   

## Shadowstuff Toxin (Poison)  

*Level 7*   

**Infection:** A creature that makes contact with or is hit with a weapon coated with shadowstuff toxin is subject to a +10 attack vs Fortitude. If hit, they are afflicted. The creature begins on stage 1.

**Progression:** Each hour the target must make a saving throw.  If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they succeed, they make no further saving throws but stay at their current stage until an antidote is administered.  

* *Stage 1:* Victim's skin and eyes turn gray.  

* *Stage 2:* Shadows cling to the victim; +2 to Stealth.  

* *Stage 3:* Victim can no longer be healed beyond staggered.   

* *Stage 4:* Victim begins to flicker from existence; +2 bonus to AC.   

* *Stage 5:* The character ceases to exist and can only be returned to life by powerful magic.   

**Cost:** 104 gp per dose  

## Sight Rot (Disease)  

*Level 9*  

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.  

**Infection:** One day after a beast or humanoid drinks water tainted by sight rot, they suffer a +12 attack vs Fortitude. On a hit, they are infected with the disease (beginning on stage 1). 

**Progression:** The creature's vision starts to become blurry.   

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 22). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.   

* *Stage 1:* The creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks.  
* *Stage 2:* The creature suffers a -4 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks.   
* *Stage 3:* The creature is blinded until treated.  

**Treatment:** Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character trained in Nature can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

## Pools of Chaos

*Level 3*

Pools of chaos are composed of raw, seething primal chaos. Proximity to a pool of chaos may bring about strange changes over time, while direct contact with the raw chaos is even quicker. 

**Changes to inanimate matter:** While immediate contact with a pit of chaos is instantly transformative, even near proximity to a pit will slowly transform objects and creatures. Objects (or portions of objects) within 20 squares of a pit of chaos have a chance of alteration as follows:

* 50 percent chance on contact, and each round after
* 10 percent chance after the first hour
* 5 percent chance after the first 24 hours
* 5 percent chance after the first month
* 5 percent chance after the first year
* 5 percent chance each year thereafter

These percentage chances are not cumulative.

When something is changed, half the time its material changes and the other half of the time its shape or texture changes. Use the Material Changes and Shape/Texture Changes tables to determine the specific type of change.

Generally these alterations cannot be reversed or repaired except through the use of an art.

* On contact, and each round after

*After spending time within 20 squares of a pit of chaos:*

* After the first hour
* After the first 24 hours

**Spellcasting near a pool of chaos:** Using incantations or arcane powers within 20 squares of a pit of chaos is a risky proposition. To successfully cast the spell the caster must attempt an Arcana check (DC 10 plus half the level of the power or incantation). If this check fails, roll on the Spellcasting Changes table to determine how the spell‚Äôs effect is changed. Some results have multiple entries ‚Äì choose the first one which applies.

##### Table ‚Äì Spellcasting Changes

| d%    | Change to the Spell Effect                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-20 | Spell target(s) or those within the area of effect are affected as if they made contact with a pool of chaos. |
| 21-50 | Near and Far spells have a random area within range (and random targets within that area where relevant). Melee and ranged spells choose targets randomly from those within range. Spells with a range of self instead target a random creature within 6 squares. |
| 51-70 | Damage-inflicting spells heal instead of harm. Penalties become bonuses and vice versa. Effects become their opposites, if applicable. |
| 71-85 | Spell energy goes wild, becoming a random spell of the same level, keeping target the same if possible. |
| 86-00 | Spell energy surges uncontrollably, exploding in a Near burst 10. +7 attack vs Reflex; on a hit, 1d12+3 force damage. |
