# Monster Statistics  

A monster has a rank, a role, a source, a type, tags and a level. For example, a giant frog might be a Standard Lurker (rank and role), Natural Beast (source and type), with the Aquatic tag, and be level 4.  

## Rank  

### Standard  

Standard monsters are the default, so this is usually left out of the description (a "Standard Assassin" is just described as an "Assassin").   

### Mooks  

Mooks are weaker monsters that can be cut down in large numbers in a single turn. Four mooks are worth one standard monster.   

* 1 HP only. A mook takes no damage from attacks that miss them.   
* x1/4 XP  
  

Mooks usually do not have a role specified, because mooks - by virtue of their low health and large numbers - usually fulfill their own role.   

### Elites  

Elites are stronger monsters. Two standard monsters are worth one elite.   

* x2 HP  
* +2 bonus on saving throws  
* 1 Action Point per encounter  
* x2 XP  
  
### Bosses  

Bosses are very strong monsters. Five standard monsters are worth one boss.   

* x4 HP  
* +5 bonus on saving throws  
* 2 Action Points per encounter  
* x5 XP  
  
## Role  

### Assassins  

Do devastating attacks every so often, interspersed with hiding or escaping.   

### Strikers  

Take advantage of mobility to make attacks and avoid being tied down in combat.   

### Archers  

Make powerful Ranged or Far attacks, or both.  

### Blockers  

Protect their allies.  

### Leaders  

Help other monster allies fight better. "Leader" is a bonus added to other roles, like Blocker (Leader) or Spoiler (Leader), rather than a pure role.   

### Spoilers  

Mess the PCs up with attacks that inflict harmful effects instead of or in addition to hit point damage.  

### Wreckers  

Bring the pain.  

## Source  

A monster's source describes where its species or type has come from. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular source.  

**Cosmic** creatures are utterly alien, aberrant beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world.   

**Elemental** creatures are native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy.  

**Fey** creatures are closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Plane of Faerie.  

**Shadow** creatures are tied to the Plane of Shadow.   

**Natural** creatures are native to the Prime Material Plane, i.e. the world.   

**Outsider** creatures are at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the material) of some Outer Plane. Some creatures start out as some other source and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence.  

## Type  

A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type.   

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.  

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals, as well as fantastical animals like winged cats or elf hounds.  

**Automatons** do not have organs or coherent bodily systems. They may be very simple creatures, like a gelatinous cube, or masses of a material that is magically animated, like a fire elemental or bronze golem. Undead that have been reanimated from a body or body parts, like skeletons and zombies, are automatons, whereas undead that have been transformed from their living form, like vampires, or undead that are a separate soul, like specters, are humanoids.   

**Humanoids** have bipedal forms, and typically are sapient and sentient, and capable of language and culture. Humanoid races include those commonly found as player characters - humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds - as well as fey like nymphs and dryads and outsiders with with humanoid forms like many devils.  

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense - frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and medusae). Others are creatures with elemental or other magical influences, like dragons.   

## Tags  

A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type. For example, a couatl is listed as Monstrosity, Dragon, Celestial. The tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.  

The most common tags follow, in some cases with some descriptive text.   

1. **Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.  
2. **Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.  
3. **Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic automatons.  
4. **Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or strange forms (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.  
5. **Earth** creatures are particularly linked to the element of earth.  
6. **Fire** creatures are particularly linked to the element of fire.  
7. **Water** creatures are particularly linked to the element of water.  
8. **Air** creatures are particularly linked to the element of air.  
9. **Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. A celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels and pegasi.  
10. **Aquatic** creatures are comfortable underwater.   
11. **Cold** creatures are particularly linked to cold energy.   
12. **Demons** are chaotic evil creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. Along with demons, they are classified as fiends. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding.   
13. **Devils** are evil creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. Along with demons, they are classified as fiends. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding.   
14. **Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore also fall into this category.  
15. **Reptiles** are scaled, cold-blooded creatures.  
16. **Shapechangers** have the innate ability to change forms.   
17. **Spiders** are eight-legged arachnids.   
18. **Swarms** are groups of creatures that act as one, like a swarm of rats or spiders.   
19. **Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.  
20. **Mounts** give their riders special benefits.   

## Alignment  

A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas an unaligned monster might be willing to negotiate.   

The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign.  

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose the monster's alignment.  

## Hit Points  

A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.   

## Speed  

A monster's speed tells you how far it can move with a Walk action. It can also take other actions that use speed, like Run and Charge.   

## Ability Scores  

Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers.   

## Skills  

The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are trained in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Perception and Stealth checks.  

A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and half its level. Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus to account for its heightened expertise.  

## Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities  

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.  

Two special resistances are described below:   

**Incorporeal:** A creature that is incorporeal takes half damage on all attacks.   

**Reactive Resistance X (immediate (counter) action, encounter):** The first time a creature is damaged by an attack that does acid, cold, lightning, fire or thunder damage, the creature gains resistance to that energy X. This lasts until the end of the encounter.   

## Senses and initiative  

The Senses entry notes a monster's passive Perception score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described in the main Rulebook.  

Perception equals half the monster's level plus its Wisdom modifier.  

Initiative equals half the monster's level plus its Dexterity modifier.    

## Languages  

The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A "-" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.  

### Telepathy  

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.  

A telepathic monster doesn't need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.  

## Level  

A monster's **level** tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat four monsters that each have a level equal to the adventurers' level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find four level 3 monsters to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.  

### Recoveries  

Although they rarely get a chance to use them, all monsters (unless otherwise mentioned) have at least 1 recovery. Level 11+ monsters have 2, and Level 21+ monsters have 3.   

### Experience Points  

The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its level. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.  

A monster's XP is also used to calculate how many monsters should be included in an encounter.

## Auras  

A creature's aura has effects on creatures within a burst X equal to the aura X listed in the monster description.   

## Actions  

When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Rulebook.   

See the Rulebook for more details of how to interpret powers.   

Special symbols are used to indicate whether an attack is a basic attack, and what its range is:   

<span style='height: 25px; width: 25px; background-color: #fff; border: 1.25px solid #000; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block;'>⚔️</span> Basic Melee Attack  

⚔️ Melee Attack  

<span style='height: 25px; width: 25px; background-color: #fff; border: 1.25px solid #000; border-radius: 50%; display: inline-block;'>🏹</span> Basic Ranged Attack  

🏹 Ranged Attack  

💥 Near Attack  

💣 Far Attack  

### Limited Usage  

Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.  

***Refresh X, Y:*** The notation "Refresh X, Y" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of refreshing during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the refresh notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also refreshes when the monster finishes a short or long rest.  

For example, "Refresh 5, 6" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.  

***Encounter:*** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.  

## Equipment  

A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.  

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.  

# Monster Templates  

Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a unique creature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from parents of different species. Other templates represent a thing that can happen to a creature, like becoming a ghost.   

A template usually turns a standard monster into an elite monster. Applying an elite template to a monster that is already an elite turns it into a boss monster.   

## Standard Bonuses  

If you apply a template to a monster, it gets the following standard bonuses depending on whether it ends up as an elite or as a boss:  

### Elites  

**From Standard to Elite:**  

* x2 HP  
* +2 bonus on saving throws  
* 1 Action Point per encounter  
* x2 XP  
  
### Bosses  

**From Standard to Boss:**  

* x4 HP  
* +5 bonus on saving throws  
* 2 Action Points per encounter  
* x5 XP  
  

**From Elite to Boss:**

🏹 **Malevolence** (standard, refresh 5, 6) ● Psychic  
Ranged 5, 1 target; Level +2 vs Will; target is controlled (save ends). You are removed from play until the target succeeds on their save, then you are placed in an unoccupied space adjacent to them. While removed from play, you do not take turns, suffer persistent damage or make saving throws.

**Dark Challenge**  
When a shade strikes a target in melee, the target is marked until the end of the shade’s next turn.  

## Adventurer  

You can apply a character class to a monster using the simple Adventurer template below.   

As with other templates, the move from standard to elite doubles a creature's HP, gives them a saving throw bonus and an additional action point.   

**Defenses:** As per the class.   

**Trained Skills:** Choose two from the class skills.   

**Class Features:** As per the class.  

**Powers:** Choose from those powers available to the class, of the creature's level or lower. Do not choose two powers of the same frequency *and* level (e.g., do not choose two level 13 encounter powers or two level 25 daily powers).   

* One at-will power.   
* One encounter power (two from level 11).   
* One daily power (two from level 21).   
* One utility power (two from level 11, three from level 21).

# Infected  

The Infected come about because of a disease, which creates lesions, warts, and boils on the skin as well as causing inflammation within the brain. Those infected think only of eating and destroying. The disease is extremely infectious and can render the target violently ill for days or weeks, bringing them near the point of death, but most of those infected make a full recovery - if they are given time.   

### Infected Animal  
Infected animals are mostly dogs with the occasional bear thrown in. They prefer running at full speed, pouncing an opponent with the basic strike, and then keeping them in place by raking at them constantly.

# Invaders  

The Invaders represent an alien invasion. This mixing of genres will not suite all fantasy campaigns, but it has been a part of the hobby since the very beginning. The Invaders may be merely an exploratory force, or a misdirected unit intended for a fight on another planet, or the full force of an interstellar armada. In any case, the creatures outlined here represent bodies (also called "shells") cobbled together by the aliens from supplies on their spaceship and whatever materials - inorganic and otherwise - that they find.   

The invasion force consists of “skinner” shock troops and “widows”, which provide command and control. Mobile artillery units are called “chanks” and the flying vehicles are “screamers”. There are also rarely seen larger “beast” mobile strongpoints.  

The Invaders have basic intelligence and, with the help of a widow, can coordinate their actions and formulate tactics. However, their overarching strategy of the entire force depends on the “Tri-Pod”—the alien commander.  

### Punk  
The punk is a larger infantry support unit with four legs, capable of laying down heavy fire against single or multiple targets. What's left of its organic head has been supplanted with considerable tracking equipment to pinpoint distant targets. The punk is also often seen an anti-aircraft weapon. It is often flanked by at least a half-dozen skinners.

### Beast  
Also known as a conversion unit, the beast is a mobile command node that expands the Invaders' influence and sphere of control. Although capable of combat, the beast prefers to remain back, while constructing more Invaders. While fixed and defended facilities produce larger units like screamers and punks, beasts expand though uncontrolled and populated areas producing ground units as fast as they can acquire raw materials. To destroy one is to cripple the enemy advancement in that area. Unfortunately, beasts are incredibly difficult to defeat. Unlike many Invaders, the beast, although cybernetic, has no visible human features.

### Mother Screamer  

Screamer is an umbrella term for one-manned aircraft operated by the shells. Both are considered attack vehicles as neither can be used as a transport. The smaller screamer is used in close quarters as a high-ground support platform for ground based infantry shells while the larger one is an anti-vehicle / crowd disposal device. The only organic compound used in the screamer is a brain (the baby often sports an exposed human skull).

# Ophiduan  

The ophiduan are an ancient race of serpentine humanoids, whom legend states have walked the earth since before the rise of mammals.  

Their cities stand in the midst of thick forests, wild jungles, hidden mountain passes, and anywhere else they can hide from the eyes of humanity. Should anyone draw near enough to see, however, the high walls and sweeping arches of their temples are unmistakable. As befits a race of snake-like creatures, their architecture favors tight spaces, ramps or shallow steps, and rooms built with floors and ledges at various heights. Their tools and weapons are similarly built, favoring flexibility and speed over brute  
force.

### Ophiduan - Hominis Caste  
The individual before you might pass for human, were it not for the supple scales that make up her skin. Her eyes are dark and unblinking, her features gaunt, her teeth unusually sharp. A dark shock of hair begins at a widow’s peak at her forehead, and flows down her neck and back.

### Ophiduan - Semiferum Caste  
This creature appears as a somehow pathetic cross of man and snake. A vaguely humanoid torso, covered in reptilian scales, melds into an enormous serpentine tail at the waist. A gaunt humanoid face, also covered in scales, bulges in odd spots as fangs far too large for the mouth push at the thin lips from within. Sporadic tufts of hair just from the top of the head, giving the creature almost a sickly appearance.

### Ophiduan - Anguineum Caste  
This creature appears to be a great serpent with humanoid features. A serpentine torso boasts a pair of slender arms, each of which is abnormally long and possessed of two elbow joints. The torso splits into two long, writhing tails. A cobra-like hood flares open behind its head, which boasts an oversized face that — despite its scales and unhinged jaw — appears as much human as snake.

**Sudden Leap** (counter action, refresh special)

**Breathsense**   
As truesight, except that a living creature who holds their breath is invisible to the jiang-shi for as long as they hold their breath. To hold their breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug their nose or cover their mouth.  

A hopping vampire.   

#### In the World  
**Distractible:** The jiang-shi is compelled to count any heap of things it comes across, like a pile of glutinous rice or a basket of hen eggs. It must spend at least one move action per round counting until it has finished (it is a very fast counter, but there can be a lot of rice in a pile). It cannot use its Special Scroll or Drink Breath powers while distracted.   

**One More Breath:** When a jiang-shi is reduced to 0 HP or below, they fall unconscious and awaken in 1 hour with full hit points. The jiang-shi must then focus for 1 minute to fully return from the Beyond. If it fails to do so (for example, because it is counting hen eggs), it is destroyed.   

**Weaknesses:** Creatures can use a mirror or ringing bell to *repel* a jiang-shi, or an altar heaped with edible offerings to the spirits to *lure* a jiang-shi (see Advanced Combat).   

**Transformation:** If a jiang-shi scholar has drunk the breath of 10 or more humanoids, then the next time it is reduced to 0 HP, it reforms as a jiang-shi magistrate. This is a good opportunity for the heroes to face the jiang-shi in a weaker form, get a sense of its powers and tactics to defeat it, and then a few days later face a more challenging jiang-shi.

**Light Sickness**  
If the stygia is exposed to bright light, it is dazed (save ends).  
**Gemsight**  
As long as the stygira holds a gemstone, they can see through the gem with darkvision and truesight. The stygira is blind when they are not holding a gem in a hand.  

**Equipment** gemstone  

A hooded humanoid that sees only through a crystal it holds in its hand, able to paralyze its prey before carting them off to be rendered down in the vast vats of their subterranean lairs.   

#### In the World  
**Stone Curse:** Wounds dealt by the stygira's claws leave the flesh bleached of color and turn the blood that runs from them dark gray. A creature petrified by the stone curse that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving throw to remove the effects of stone curse.  

**Oracles:** Stygira know divination magic pertaining to reading omens, clairaudience, reading auras and auguries.

#### Special  
Those stygira with particularly precious gemstones may have different gaze attacks.

**Speed** 6, climb 2  
(⚔️) **Leg** (standard action, at-will)  
Melee, +14 vs AC, 2d12+4 damage.  
⚔ ️**Jaws** (standard action, refresh 4, 5, 6) ● Acid  
Melee, +14 vs AC, 4d8+5 acid damage and target is overly generous (save ends).   
💥 **Bile** (standard action, refresh 4, 5, 6) ● Acid  
Near arc 3, +14 vs Fortitude, 2d12+4 acid damage and target is overly-generous (save ends).  
🏹 **Item Toss** (react action, bauble beast is handed a gift; at-will)  
Ranged 10, +14 vs AC, 4d8+5 damage and the gift lands in the target's space.   
**Bile Duct** ( action, when Staggered; encounter)  
Make an immediate *bile* attack, whether or not it is refreshed. Both *bile* and *jaws* then immediately refresh.   

A large, four-legged creature with two unexpectedly small and graceful arms and a blocky head, the bauble beast's mustard-yellow hide is spotted with what appear to be precious stones. 

#### In the World  
**Forge Jewelry:** The bauble beast creates imitation jewelry within its own digestive system. This takes about 4 hours. Determining the jewelry is fake works like detecting a forgery. The process of creating fake jewelry also places an enchantment inside the item. Anyone who dons the imitation jewelry is targeted with a +14 attack vs Will. On a hit, a creature that fails learns the location where the fake jewelry was created and is compelled for one hour to collect their valuable belongings and bring them to that location. Removing the imitation jewelry ends the effect immediately, but the wearer can't take it off voluntarily.  

#### Special  
The bauble beast introduces a new condition, 'overly-generous'.  

**Overly-generous:** The creature spends up to one move action and up to one swift action per round trying to give away an item of value. Unless a particular creature requests a gift and/or requests a particular gift, the gift is chosen randomly and the target is chosen randomly among those that can be reached with a single move.  

#### Tactics
The bauble beast uses its attacks until it has been given enough valuable items, at which point it runs away.

### Phrenic Scourge  
This horrific being stands as a human, but is clearly nothing of the sort. A dark and tattered robe only partly covers a body that appears to be formed entirely of squirming, writhing tendrils in hues of off-white, corpse-gray, and sickly purples and blues. Lengths of these tendrils hang from its sleeves as hands, while others make up a visage that cannot, in any sense of the word, be called a face. It steps forward with a shambling, yet somehow graceful, gait.

### Scavenger Worm  
This insectoid creature might be mistaken for a simple giant centipede, were it not for the circular, moray-like maw, the hard reflective chitin that clicks as it moves, and its complete lack of eyes. Something green and foul-smelling trickles from its mouth.

### Tunnel Brute  
This is a brutal giant with insectoid features. Although humanoid in shape, it is covered in a hard chitin. Its eyes are faceted, and its mouth boasts two pairs of mandibles, the lower larger than the upper. It hunches as it walks, its knuckles nearly dragging the floor, and a large tail with a needle-like stinger curls up above its head. A horrific, oppressive stench emanates from the creature; the air around it almost seems to simmer with the fumes.

### Evil Eye  
An enormous floating eye, apparently ripped raw from the skull of some giant beast, hovers in the air before you. Lengths of optic nerve writhe and thrash behind it like tails, fading away after several feet into thin wisps of white mist. That same white mist is visible in the eye’s dark pupil, as though through a window to some distant world.

# Appendix: Creating New Monsters  

This guide will step you through the process of creating a new monster.  

### Level and Rank  

At what level do you expect heroes to fight this monster? That is the monster's level.  

If a monster has a resistance or vulnerability "X" listed, this is equal to 5 for monsters level 1-10, 10 for monsters level 11-20 and 15 for monsters level 21-30.   

When the heroes fight the monster, do you expect it to challenge four or five heroes (Boss rank), two or three heroes (Elite rank), one hero (Standard rank) or only to challenge one hero when there are about four of the monster (Mook rank)?   

### Size, Source, Type and Tags  

This is a naturalistic description of how large the monster is, which plane of existence it comes from, what form its body takes and any additional categories it falls into.

### Senses  

* The monster is blind: Blind tag, resistance to radiant X.   
  
* The monster can see in the dark: Darkvision.   
* The monster can see well in poor lighting: Low-light vision.   
* The monster can accurately sense the presence of creatures without seeing, e.g. through echolocation: Blindsight 10.   
* The monster can accurately sense the presence of creatures in contact with the ground, e.g. through vibrations: Tremorsense 10.   
* The monster can see through shapechanging magic, illusions, invisibility, etc.: Truesight 10.   
  
### Movement  

Most monsters have a regular speed, which is their speed on land (walking). A monster that is as fast as a human should have a speed of 6.   

Some monsters can also swim, climb, fly, burrow or teleport.  

There are a number of special movement properties:   

* The monster can move unimpeded through certain difficult terrain: Terrain Stride.   
* The monster's feet are grippy, allowing it to travel across sheer surfaces and upside down across ceilings: Wall-Walker.   
* The monster can move through obstacles as if they weren't there: Phasing.   
* The monster is a good flier or swimmer but clumsy on the ground: Clumsy on Ground -4.  
* The monster is a poor flier but comfortable on the ground: Clumsy in Air -4.  
* The monster is a poor swimmer but comfortable on the ground: Clumsy in Water -4.   
* The monster can stay in place while flying, even while knocked unconscious: Hover.   
* The monster can fly or levitate, but not above 10 feet: Maximum Altitude 2.   
* The monster can squish into very small spaces: Compress  
  
### Powers  

The best way to determine good powers for a monster is to look at similar, existing monsters. However, here is some guidance about the kind of damage that powers should do, by level.   

For each power you design, identify whether it has a single target or two or more targets, and whether it is usable at-will or less frequently (for the purpose of this table, powers usable once per encounter and usable on a refresh are counted together as "surge" powers). This determines how much damage it should do, by level.  

**Type** 

Mooks deal static damage, and in general should only target one creature with each attack.   

Elites should have powers that allow them to attack roughly twice as often as standard monsters. 

Bosses should have powers that allow them to attack roughly four times as often as standard monsters. 

**Role**

Creatures with the wrecker role do bonus damage on all attacks. Mooks with the wrecker role should only add half that number to their damage.
