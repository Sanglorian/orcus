# Character Elements  

Making a first-level character involves choosing a few key elements:  

- An ancestry.  
- A class.  
- A kit, if you play with them, or a feat, if not.  
- Some trained skills.  
- Some powers.   
  

As well as setting their six ability scores and purchasing equipment.   

Of these choices, class is the most consequential.   

As a character increases in level, they will make other choices, picking up other feats and powers, and - at certain levels - a prestige path and an epic path as well.   

# Classes  

Every character belongs to a class, which they choose at first level. They will remain a member of this class during their entire adventuring career - perhaps up to level 30, the highest level available.     

Since there are ways to get some of the perks of other classes, such as multiclass feats and kits, the original class you chose is sometimes referred to as your "base class". If you do pick up other classes, you count as a member of those classes, but they will never affect your character as much as your base class does.     

## Traditions and Roles  

Each class has one or more traditions, which summarize where that class draws most of its power from.   

* **Arcane:** The practitioners of the arcane tradition seek to understand the unexplainable, categorize the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in a systematic way. If your power comes from arcane magic, it is studied or learned. A bard studies songs that have magical effects; a warlock bargains for or steals magical knowledge from powerful extraplanar beings; and a wizard researches and memorizes magical spells.   
* **Divine:** The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Material Plane. If your power comes from divine magic, it is granted by the gods or other higher powers. A cleric is or was part of the organized hierarchy of a religion. Paladins serve the gods directly or a cause that a god favors.   
* **Martial:** Your power comes from strength at arms, experience in battle and training. Martial adventurers have extraordinary abilities, but they are grounded in what is humanly possible.   
* **Spirit:** An instinctual connection to  and faith in the world, the cycle of day and night, the turning of the  seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey drive the spirit tradition. If your power comes from the spirit tradition, it is drawn from the natural world or the spirits of the world. A barbarian is ridden by the spirits for their own purposes; a druid serves the spirits and is empowered by them as a reward. A shaman consults and calls friendly spirits.   
* **Phrenic:** The strength of psyche and emotions. The phrenic power source represents the power inherent in all sentient beings, the ability to draw forth the spark of life, that inner fire which gives strength to convictions. In some, it takes the form of extreme dedication, unusual courage, or an unbreakable discipline. But in others, it takes on physical form. Their font of power is so great that they can manipulate the world around them by using it.

Each class has one or two roles, which summarize how the class most often contributes in combat.  

* **Defender:** A defender soaks up attacks and damage from enemies, punishes enemies for attacking their allies *and* punishes enemies for attacking the defender. The defender forces enemies to make difficult decisions or puts them in a "catch-22".  
* **Striker:** A striker does the most damage or otherwise puts enemies out of action, particularly if they are supported by their allies - but they can be vulnerable if they are left exposed.   
* **Leader:** A leader helps their allies do their jobs better in combat, by keeping them alive through healing and defensive bonuses, by increasing their damage output or other contributions, and by enabling them to do things that they couldn't do before (even if that is as simple as helping them get into position for an attack).  
* **Controller:** A controller gives the team control over the battlefield, with crowd control attacks, area denial or impeded movement that limits where and how enemies can move, and negative conditions that reduce what the enemies can do or how effectively they do it.    
  

**Table - Roles and Traditions**  

|             | Controller        | Defender  | Leader    | Striker      |  
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------ |  
| **Arcane**  | Specialist Wizard | Mageblade |           |              |  
| **Divine**  |                   |           | Crusader  |              |  
| **Martial** | Jester            | Guard     | Commander | Swashbuckler |  
| **Spirit**  | Reaper            |           |           | Sylvan       |  

## Powers  

Classes follow the default power progression, shown below, unless otherwise mentioned.  

The numbers indicate powers from your class (although note that sometimes you will have the opportunity to select a power not of your class, but filling a class slot).   

"P" indicates a power from your prestige path, so for example at level 11 you will typically gain an encounter attack power from your prestige path. "E" indicates a power from your epic path.   

The appendix has a table that shows which level powers a character of a particular level (following the default progression) can have. This is useful if you are creating a character at higher than 1st level, or if you get confused about which powers can be replaced when.   

When you reach a level that allows you to replace a power, you choose a class attack power you know of that frequency (encounter or daily) and give it up, exchanging it for a power of the level you're gaining. For example, at level 13 you can give up one of your existing encounter attack powers (e.g., the one you got at level 1) in exchange for a level 13 encounter attack power.

# Kits  

Kits are another way of customizing your character at first level, if permitted by the Game Master (see "Playing with Kits", below). They represent another facet to your character that isn't captured by their race or their class.   

You can retrain a kit using your one permitted retrain per level.   

Kits will typically give features a few times during the adventurer tier, usually starting with a feature or two at level 1.   

### Playing with Kits  

Game Masters can approach kits in a few different ways:  

1. Each character gets a kit at first level.   
2. No character gets a kit.   
3. Characters can choose a kit, but they have to give up some of their feats to do so.   

If you play with the third option, characters must give up three of their adventurer-tier feats (levels 1, 4 and 10) in order to access one kit's features, or all six of their adventurer-tier feats (levels 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) to access one kit's features and the discipline associated with that kit. Of course, you can always allow player characters to pick up a kit at a later time, as long as they give up the same number of feats.   

### About Kits  

Kits are usually named starting with a verb, like "Dabbles in Wizardry", "Takes Vermin Form", "Binds Familiar" or "Manifests Mindblade".  

"Dabbles in ..." kits are ways to multiclass. "Worships the ..." kits are for worshippers of different gods (what might be called domains). "Specializes in ..." kits are for those who specialize in a particular school of arcane magic.

<figure><img src="pics\Joshu.jpg" alt="Joshu" style="zoom: 20%;" /><figcaption>Joshu by Sarah Carney</figcaption></figure>  

**Spirit Friend (Level 1):** You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose (from the list below).  

The familiar obeys the following rules:  

*Actions*  

* If you take a move action, the familiar can take a move action as well.  
* You can give up actions to command the familiar, in which case it gets to take the same actions. For example, you can give up your standard action in order for the familiar to take a standard action.   
  

*Stats and Combat*  

* All familiars have 1 hit point, but they are never damaged on a miss. Your own attacks never target your familiar, even if they normally target "all creatures".   
* When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after your next extended rest.   
* Your familiar uses your Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses.   
* Your familiar cannot contribute to a flank.   
  

*Hidden Away/Called*  

* As a swift action, your familiar can hide away on your person, which may involve disappearing in a puff of smoke until you call them again, or turning into a tattoo on your arm or a statuette in your pocket, or simply slipping into your pocket. While hidden away, it provides you with no benefits, but it also cannot be targeted by any effect, does not take damage, etc.   
* You can call a hidden away familiar as a swift action. It appears in a square adjacent to you.   
  

*Other*  

* Your familiar always obeys your commands.  
* While your familiar is within 20 squares of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.  
* If you retrain this kit, you can select a different familiar.   
* The familiar is an ally of you, and of your allies.  
* The familiar is of human-like intelligence, although it may think very differently to humanoids or not be communicative.   
  

**Combat Assistant (Level 5):** Your familiar gets a +1 bonus to all defenses.   

While your familiar is hidden away, you get a +1 bonus to Reflex defense.  

While your familiar is called, you get a +1 bonus on attack rolls against enemies adjacent to or in the same space as your familiar.   

**Speedy Summons (Level 10):** Your familiar gets a further +1 bonus to all defenses.   

Your familiar reappears after your next short rest if it drops to 0 hit points.   

**Associated Discipline:** Strong Bidding.

You have always displayed confidence in the way you talk and present yourself. You don't even need to be all that physically attractive; you simply project a presence that encourages followers. Thankfully, beyond the simple aura of your charisma, you're also clever enough to know what to say at the right times to have the greatest effect. You know that how you speak means more than the words themselves. Even if you're not the leader of the group, you often do most of the talking when the need arrives. In your spare time, you socialize with others.  

**Commanding Presence (Level 1):** Choose one of the following auras at character generation. Once per day, you can activate an aura as a swift action, which lasts until the end of the encounter, unless you end it as a swift action or you fall unconscious. Unlike stances, multiple auras can be in effect at once.  

* **By Example** aura 2; allies in the aura gain a +2 power bonus to Fortitude defense and Will defense.  
  
* **Field Advice** aura 2; allies in the aura gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws except death saves and saves against unconsciousness.  
  
* **Mask of Authority** aura 2; allies in the aura gain a +2 power bonus to damage rolls with basic attacks. *Level 11:* +3 power bonus. *Level 21:* +4 power bonus.   
* **Stand as One** aura 2; whenever an ally in the aura regains hit points, he regains additional hit points equal to your Charisma or Intelligence modifier. In addition, the action required for second wind is reduced from standard to move, or from move to minor. *Level 11:* Additional hit points equal to 4 + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier *Level 21:* Additional hit points equal to 8 + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier  
* **Strategic Precision** aura 2; allies in the aura gain a +1 power bonus to attack rolls against the last target you hit.  
  

**What a Guy (Level 5):** As a swift action, you can spend a recovery, but regain no hit points; instead, you extend any Command Presence auras you have in effect by a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier until the end of your next turn.  

**Presence of Leadership (Level 10):** When you use the Rally action, one ally in your aura can spend a recovery to heal damage equal to their recovery value.  

**Associated Discipline:** Born Leadership.  

## Exemplifies Intelligence  

Your strengths are not in your endurance, speed, or ability to shoot something with pinpoint accuracy. You use a part of the body most of your comrades seem to let necrotize, your brain. You're the one with all the answers, an encyclopedia of knowledge. You went to school; you have degrees and awards of merit. You understand that you may be on the border between genius and madness, but all the great minds of the world balance that knife-edge. In your spare time, you read.  

**Priority Target (Level 1):** You gain a +1 bonus to AC and Reflex. In addition, if you don't use any attack powers on your turn, until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex defense.  

**Focused Expertise (Level 5):** Select one Intelligence- or Wisdom-based skill. Apply both your Intelligence and Wisdom modifiers to that skill.  

**Surgical Precision (Level 10):** Targets suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any conditions you inflict.  

**Associated Discipline:** High Cunning.  

## Exemplifies Speed  

With unmatched physical discipline, you have perfected a body designed for raw speed and agility. You are not a born soldier. If you served time in the military, your talents were as a scout, lightly armored and light on your feet. You may have grown up with an eye for sports. You broke records in the dash and ran for hours in marathons while others fell exhausted by the roadside. This was still not enough and you soon began finding more challenging ways to get from point A to point B. Climbing walls, jumping across roofs, sliding under cars - nothing stood in your way. It’s not enough just to be athletic: you have to keep your eyes and mind sharp, to gauge distances, crawlspaces, and the shortest possible route even if it involves some death-defying feat of acrobatic skill. You can keep an entire landscape in mind, analyzing paths and routes of escape, even when everyone else just sees walls. This may not be raw brainpower but a natural instinct of the surrounding environment. In your spare time, you run.  

**Power To Weight Ratio (Level 1):**  You can use Dexterity in place of Strength for Athletics checks when performing a climb or a jump. You can also use Dexterity in place of Strength for attack or damage rolls with unarmed attacks or one-handed melee weapons, as well as grapples.  

You do not grant combat advantage while balancing.  

**Speed Vault (Level 5):** If you move at least 2 squares while running toward a wall, you gain a climb speed equal to your remaining movement. If you have not cleared the wall by the end of your movement, you must make an Athletics check to climb normally.  

**Split-Slide (Level 10):** Once per round, use a swift action and select one enemy in line of sight. You do not provoke opportunity attacks from that enemy and can pass through the enemy’s square as if it wasn't occupied. You cannot end your movement in the square.  

**Associated Discipline:** Born to Run.  

## Exemplifies Strength  

You are a beast. Blessed with amazing stamina and brutal strength, you base your reputation upon the build you were gifted with and train daily to maintain. You were self-taught, trained by a coach, or beaten down by a drill instructor. You might have earned a name in a ring or on the combat field. You could be an imposing behemoth or a gentle giant, only raising your hand when necessary. Regardless of what kind of pitiful body you were born with, you have worked up to nothing less than the physique of legends. In your spare time, you work to maintain your physical perfection.   

**Full Torque (Level 1):** You can use Strength in place of Dexterity for all attack and damage rolls with weapons with the light thrown and heavy thrown properties and with weapons from the slings and bows weapon groups.   

**No Time for Pain (Level 5):** If you are staggered, add your Strength modifier to your recovery value.  

**Comical Reaction (Level 10):** If you succeed on a saving throw for the following conditions, you gain a basic attack as a free action: blinded, dazed, deafened, slowed, stunned, or weakened.  

**Associated Discipline:** Juggernautical.  

## Channels Godmind

You can focus your mind to unlock your psychic potential. 

**Psi Focus (Level 1):** You have access to psi focus, a heightened state of mental and emotional clarity, that you can utilize to augment powers with the Augmentable keyword. This psi focus, once used, must refresh, much like how certain monsters have powers that refresh at the beginning of their turn on a successful roll. Psi focus works in the exact same way, but the roll needed to refresh it depends on what kind of power it was last used to augment.  

> #### Psi Focus
> *Utilizing your phrenic power, you heighten a power or ability beyond what others could fathom.*
> **At-Will** **Free Action**
> **Channels Godmind Utility Feature** ● **Phrenic**
> **Self** 
> **Effect:** When using an Augmentable power, you activate the effect noted under the Augment: line.
> **Special:**  *Psi focus* refreshes on a 4, 5 and 6 after using it to augment an at-will power, on a 5 and 6 after using it to augment an encounter power, and on a 6 after using it to augment a daily power. You can not use *psi focus* unless it is recharged.

**Mantle (Level 5):** Once per encounter you can draw strength from your Mantle. With this powerful connection to your godmind, you can activate *focal surge* or *intensity*.

> #### Focus Surge
> *You tap into the mental connection between yourself and your Godmind, allowing you to refresh the phrenic energies of either yourself or an ally.*
> **Mantle** **Swift Action**
> **Channels Godmind Utility Feature** ● **Phrenic**
> **Near** burst 5 (10 at level 11, 15 at level 21), you or an ally
> **Effect:** The target can spend one focus surge and recharge their *psi focus*.

> #### Intensity
> *You focus on your connection with your Godmind and you become more intensely focused on your next action.*

> **Channels Godmind Utility Feature** ● **Phrenic**
> **Self** 
> **Effect:** You gain a +1 bonus to your next attack and damage roll.

**Focused (Level 10):** You have a number of focus surges equal to your Charisma modifier.  Your focus surges are replenished after a long rest.

You can also perform the meditate action. 

> **MEDITATE: STANDARD ACTION**
>
> You meditate for a short while, regaining your inner focus and becoming in tune with both your inner well of power and the world around you.
>
> - **Spend a Focus Surge:** Spend a focus surge to regain your psi focus.
> - **+2 bonus to Will Defense:** You gain a +2 bonus to your Will Defense until the start of your next turn.
> - **Once per Encounter:** You can meditate once per encounter and can use this action again after you take a short rest or an extended rest. Some powers (either yours or another character’s) allow you to spend focus surges without meditating.

**Associated Discipline (Level 1):** Third Mind.

> **Self**   
> **Effect:** You take the form of a particular creature. Allies of that creature must make a saving throw each time they target you with an attack. If the save fails, they must target the attack so it does not affect you, or the attack fails. Lasts until the end of your next turn.  

**Adaptable Body (Level 5):** While the target of a power with the Transmutation keyword, you get a +1 bonus to all defences and a +1 bonus to speed.   

**Reflexive Shaper (Level 10):** You gain the *instinctive shift* daily utility power.

# Disciplines  

A discipline is a set of powers that are thematically related. Characters get access to disciplines from their classes, and sometimes from other sources. Having access to a discipline just means you can choose powers from that discipline when you get to select class powers; it does not give you immediate access to those powers.   

### Key and Secondary Abilities  

Some classes specify that powers selected from class disciplines use different abilities to those specified. If you gain access to the powers of a discipline from another source, this rule does not apply.   

*For example, Arty is a Goading Swashbuckler, which lets him replace a power's secondary ability with Charisma. He selects the power* deadly thrust *from Blades in the Dark, which identifies Strength as its secondary ability. He uses Charisma in place of Strength when using that ability.*  

*Porthy is a Fighter with the kit "Dabbles in Swashbuckling", which gives him access to the Blades in the Dark discipline. However, since his access to the discipline comes from his kit, not his class, he cannot use Charisma in place of Strength when using Blades in the Dark powers.*

## Elemental Flux  

When you first gain a power with the Flux tag, choose an element: lightning, acid, cold, fire or thunder. All powers with the Flux keyword have that energy as a keyword, and replace any reference to [flux] in the power text with that energy. There are some powers that allow you to change your flux energy, if you take them. You can also change your flux energy when you retrain at a new level. Some classes interact with Flux powers in other ways.   

When a power refers to [flux], it always means your current flux energy, even if you used the power when your flux energy was different. For example, if you conjured a vortex devil, it does damage of your current flux energy not the flux energy you had when you conjured it.

## Rapier's Point  

Many of these powers use momentum. Other than these powers, the main way to gain momentum is through the features of the Swashbuckler class. You are welcome to take these powers without belonging to the Swashbuckler class (provided you have access to this discipline), but if they involve momentum they may be of limited use to you.   

If you do gain momentum from a power, the same rule for losing momentum applies as for the Swashbuckler: you lose it if you are hit by any attack.

## Spells of Ice and Fire  

When you first gain a power with the Flux tag, choose an element: lightning, acid, cold, fire or thunder. All powers with the Flux keyword have that energy as a keyword, and replace any reference to [flux] in the power text with that energy. There are some powers that allow you to change your flux energy, if you take them. You can also change your flux energy when you retrain at a new level. Some classes interact with Flux powers in other ways.   

When a power refers to [flux], it always means your current flux energy, even if you used the power when your flux energy was different. For example, if you conjured a vortex devil, it does damage of your current flux energy not the flux energy you had when you conjured it.   

Note that the Spells of Ice and Fire discipline is dedicated to the cold and fire flux energies. You can use these powers while you have a different flux energy active, but you don't get any of the special "Cold" or "Fire" riders.

## Martial Arts Champion  

Surrounded on all sides, armed with little more than your iron will, you've stood your ground and defeat whatever lies ahead. They can have knives, crossbows, or broadswords; it’s all meaningless to you.  

**Prerequisite:** Unarmed Combat feat.  

### Class Features  

**Carry Through (11th level):** Once per round, if you roll a critical hit, roll maximum damage on any of your dice, or drop a target with a melee attack, you immediately deal damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier to one target in reach.  

**Bad Idea (11th level):** You can spend an action point to make a melee basic attack against each adjacent target, instead of taking an extra action.  

**Unstoppable Momentum (16th level):** If you inflict any of the following conditions on a target - dazed, slowed, stunned, or weakened - one creature in an adjacent square to the initial target suffers the same condition until the start of your next turn.  

### Powers

> **Encounter** **Free Action**  
> **Martial Arts Champion Attack 11** ● **Martial**  
> **Self**   
> **Trigger:**  You hit a creature with a melee weapon.  
> **Effect:** Until the end of your next turn, each time you hit the triggering creature with a melee attack, you push it 2 squares and knock it prone. If the creature cannot be pushed 2 squares, it takes additional damage equal to twice your Dexterity modifier and is dazed until the start of your next turn. If the target is pushed, you can immediately shift into an adjacent square.  
> **Maintain:**  Swift: The effect persists against the same target. You can maintain until it is dazed.

## Prince of Shadows  

**_Requirements:_** Your class has the Striker role.  

You are recognized by every brigand and cutpurse, every sneakthief and bandit. Cat burglars are your courtiers; extortionists your earls. The darkness is your cloak and crown.  

### Class Features  

**Trusty Action (11th level):** You perform … not quite reliably, but always with spectacular results.  

When you use an action point to take an extra action, the action always succeeds (you pass your skill check or at least one attack roll in an attack no matter your roll, for example). If you would fail, you succeed but there’s a side-effect or "sting in the tail" - like a tremendous success drawing unwanted attention or a desperate lunge slaying your enemy but leaving you open to their allies.   

**_Do As I Do (11th level):_** You are used to leading teams along corridors on tip-toes or up walls without rope or crampon. No one can afford to fail.  

When you make a skill check, allies gain a +2 power bonus to the same skill until the beginning of your next turn.   

**_The Cloak is My Shadow, I Shall Not Want (16th level):_** Your cloak billows as you move, hiding you away until it seems to be all cloak and no man.

> **Prince of Shadows Utility 16** ● **Shadow, Teleport**  
> **Self**

> **Miss:**  The creature is transported to the extradimensional space only till the end of your next turn, and it takes no damage.

# Epic Paths  

At level 21, each player character gets an epic path. This path is on top of their main class, which still gives them some powers, and their prestige path (which stops giving them powers after level 20).   

Traditionally, each epic path has given the player character a way to cheat death, and a way to achieve to immortality. Some of the epic paths included below are more understated, and do not necessarily include these options. Of course, just because a path does not describe a way to achieve immortality, does not mean immortality is out of reach for that character.   

**Table - Epic Paths and Their Requirements**  

| Name            | Description                                                  |  
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |  
| Agent Retriever | You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need. |  
| Master          | You are the single greatest expert on the planet on a specific subject. |  
| Most Dangerous  | No one who hunts you knows your real name. You’re a ghost.   |  
| Respected       | Every soldier that passes you knows your face and gives you the courtesy you have earned. |  
| Team            | It was always, and will always be, about the team.           |  
| Ultimate        | As the legendary fighter, you have too many laurels to count. |  

## Agent Retriever  

Elemental tyrants, the heralds of the gods, the voices between the planets - they all have peculiar needs, and the agents retriever cater to them. You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need.   

**Requirements:** You must have retrieved something of value from another plane of existence, and traded it for a fair price.   

### Immortality  

When your adventuring days come to an end, a number of different fates may await you. What follows is one possibility.   

**Corner of the World's Eye:** You fade away from public view, but no one can ever confirm your death. Just when people think old age, misadventure or vengeance must have done you in, someone reports spying you in a bazaar, or finding your calling card in the Celestial Vaults, or seeing you for a moment through a pool in the Astral Plane.   

### Class Features  

**Appropriation (Level 21):** Each night, you dream of a magic item. After a long rest, choose any magic item of your level or lower. That magic item appears under your bedroll, ready for use. It disappears when you begin your next long rest.   

The magic item is not created, it is summoned. The GM may want to identify which creature's possession the magic item was summoned from, and whether there are any hints to your identity when it arrives back in their possession the following day.   

**Interplanar Contingencies (Level 24):** Once per day, when you die, you appear the following round on your initiative count with half your maximum HP and under the slowed condition, in an unoccupied space of your choice at least 6 squares from your dead body. You cannot use any attack powers or recoveries, but you have all the equipment and magic items that were on your person when you died. The equipment and magic items that are actually on your body become shimmering and insubstantial, and cannot be used or picked up.    

When you are adjacent to your corpse, you can use a swift action to merge the old and new bodies. You can now use attack powers and recoveries, although you do not recover any powers or recoveries that were already spent. You lose the slowed condition, but otherwise keep the HP and any conditions, persistent damage, etc., of your new body. Choose which square your merged body appears in.   

**The Economic Flow (Level 30):** You are at the center of a vast trade network. If something is for sale anywhere in the planes, for any price, you can purchase it with a snap of your fingers (free action). The object appears in your hand or on your person, if feasible, or otherwise in the nearest unoccupied space(s) that can hold it. The payment price must be on your person (for example, a pouch of gold pieces on your belt) - it disappears at the same time as the purchased object appears.  

### Powers  

> #### Force Sphere  
> **Daily** **Immediate (Counter) Action**  
> **Agent Retriever Utility 26** ● **Arcane, Force, Zone**  
> **Near** burst X  
> **Effect:** Create a sphere of force in a near burst between 1 and 5 squares in radius (your choice). The sphere is impenetrable by any means.  
> **Maintain:**  Swift  

## Master  

You are the single greatest expert on the planet on a specific subject. All others bend to your word. Long after you have passed on, your papers and essays will be analyzed for hidden truths previously undiscovered. Your name will be uttered in the same breaths of legends from centuries past. Whatever vocation you have chosen, competitors and publishers will jostle for your contract should you leave your present employment.

> **Special:**  Once you use this power, you cannot recover it except by taking a long rest.  

## Most Dangerous  

No one who hunts you knows your real name. You’re a ghost. Enemies and allies don't have just one nickname for you; there are several. Few are aware of all your accomplishments. Most of these victories were erased or never directly connected to you. Others you must deny. You career might never have existed at all. Missions that you took were probably illegal, extremely difficult, with no room for failure. Your handle or moniker labels you as one of the most wanted individuals on the planet.  

### Class Features  

**Second Nature (21st level):** You reroll natural 1s and 2s on attack rolls and skill checks, but you must take the second result even if it is another 1 or a 2.

> **Self**   
> **Effect:** You can take an additional standard action and an additional move action on this turn and on your next turn.  

## Respected  

Your uniform weighs you down with the number of medals and honors bestowed. You have reached the point where brandishing such decorations is meaningless. Every soldier that passes you knows your face and gives you the courtesy you have earned. You can sway thousands by your command. Your advice is taken to heart by high priests, archmages, and kings. You don't win battles. You win wars.

> **Effect:** The target regains one expended power. The target also gains an action point he must use before the end of his next turn.  

## Team  

It has never been about personal glory or selfish ideals. From the beginning, you have stood tall among others you have treated as equals, others that have returned that honor a hundred times over. You have all lost count how many engagements you have shared, the taken bullets, the close calls. It was always, and will always be, about the team. It's been years or even decades and none of you will quit until the others do. You each push to be the best and as a result, you all are.  

### Class Features  

**Team Support (21st level):** Spend a recovery as a swift action but regain no hit points; instead, all epic-tier allies in line of sight automatically save against one effect a save can end (except dying) at the start of their next turn.

## Ultimate  

As the legendary fighter, you have too many laurels to count. In the old age, you would have been given freedom by the Caesar or awarded a lordship and a manor for your deeds. You have the blood of kings. History is written by the winners and you have seldom seen defeat.  

### Class Features  

**Why Won’t You Die? (21st level** ): Attacks cannot score critical hits against you (take normal damage).  

**Glory of the Fight (24th level):** If you kill a non-mook enemy, you gain a standard, a move, and a swift action that you must use before the end of your next turn.  

**Risky Maneuver (30th level):** As a free action, you can reduce all your defense values to 1. After you are hit three times by enemy attacks, you defenses return to normal and your next attack roll is an automatic critical hit.
