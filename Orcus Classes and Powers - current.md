# Creating a Character

To create an *Orcus* character, take the following steps:

1. Choose your class. Your character’s class will have a greater effect on their powers and capabilities than any other choice you make, so it makes sense to make it first. Some classes require you to make other choices once you select them, such as choosing a talent (a sub-class). 
2. Choose your ancestry. Your character’s ancestry is their background, cultural origin and/or race, depending on the setting. Different settings may have different rules for ancestries. The Outlaw Kingdoms setting splits ancestry into two choices: crux and background. 
2. Choose a feat or a kit. By default, characters can either choose six feats over the course of their first 10 levels (one at level 1), or choose one kit that provides a package of features over the same 10 levels. 
3. Calculate your ability scores. You have six ability scores: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. Different campaigns will calculate ability scores in different ways, but the default is called “point buy". 
4. Choose your trained skills. Your class will say how many trained skills you have, and provide the list from which you can choose your trained skills. 
5. Choose your powers. By default, a first-level character chooses two at-will attack powers, one encounter attack power and one daily attack power. Your class and kit will say which “disciplines” (lists of powers) you can choose your powers from. 
7. Purchase equipment. You begin with 100 gold pieces with which to purchase equipment. Characters beginning at later levels start with more gold, and with magic items. 
8. Calculate all other stats. You should now have made all the choices you need to make in order to calculate your character’s defenses, attack bonuses, damage bonuses, skill bonuses, hit points, staggered value, recoveries and recovery value, and so on. 

If you create a character at a higher level than 1, the process is similar, except you choose more feats and powers,  and you will also choose a prestige path (if level 11 or higher) and epic path (if level 21 or higher). 

## Archetypes

Here are some example archetypes, and how you might model them in *Orcus*.

**Assassin/Ninja:** A mystical rogue can be created with the Mageblade, perhaps coupled with the Brews Poisons kit. Exemplifies Speed is another good choice for a kit. 

**Barbarian/Berserker:** With its focus on Constitution, the Sylvan class is a good start. Any Wild Gift could work for a berserker. For kits, Exemplifies Strength is a safe choice and even includes some powers that resemble raging. Otherwise a berserker might Eat Monster Hearts, Dabble in Guarding or Worship the God of War, or even Channel Godmind to reflect the influence of a clan spirit or ancestor. 

**Beastmaster:** A Sylvan with the Animal Companion Wild Gift and the Binds Familiar kit can have two animal friends, and turn into a third. 

**Blackguard:** A Guardian who Worships the God of Tyranny or a Crusader are good choices. 

**Blue Mage:** A Magician who Eats Monster Hearts is a good model for a blue mage. 

**Cleric:** The Crusader is a classic cleric. 

**Demonologist:** Either the Magician (Conjurer) class or the Conjures Fiends kit would be enough to turn a character into a demonologist; taken together they would represent a very strong demonologist archetype. Consider as an alternative taking the Conjures Fiends kit with a different class for a different take on the demonologist: the hellish knight (with the Guardian class), the Harlequin whose fiddle comes from the Devil, or the Mageblade who fights alongside the fiends they conjure. 

**Druid:** The Sylvan has both *wild shape* and an animal companion covered, so it is a good pick for druids. You may want to pick the Skinchanger Wild Gift and then the Charms Animal kit to have an animal companion that you can still make full use of while *wild shaped* yourself (normally, you cannot use most powers – including those that involve your companion – while in *wild shape* form). 

**Elementalist:** A Mageblade with many powers from the Elemental Flux discipline is a natural elementalist. The Dabbles in Wizardry kit for the Spells of Ice and Fire discipline would add further elemental options, if needed – as would choosing an elemental familiar from Binds Familiar. 

**Fighter (Agile):** The Exemplar or Harlequin.

**Fighter (Heavily Armored):** The Guardian or Commander. 

**Jack of All Trades/Savant/Red Mage:** A Mageblade who takes a lot of Veiled Moon powers is already stealthy, skilled with weapons and able to cast magic spells. Taking Worships the God of Life or Dabbles in Crusading on top of that would provide divine power to round out an already versatile character. 

**Magic Dabbler:** Any character could get a strong dose of non-combat magic with the Cantrip Master feat and an investment in incantations. 

**Monk/Martial Artist:** The Martial Training feats, especially the Unarmed Combat feat chain, could turn any weapon-focused character into a martial artist – consider Mageblade for a mystic martial artist, Harlequin for a taunting drunken boxer, Exemplar for an agile combatant or even Guardian for a sturdy defender. The Channels Godmind kit would add a psychic, meditative element to the build. 

**Mounted Knight:** A Guardian who Charms Animal can pick a horse, giving themselves a powerful and obedient mount and powers that take full advantage of it. 

**Paladin:** The Crusader class serves perfectly well for a paladin focused on healing and inspiring their allies. Otherwise, try a Guardian who Dabbles in Commanding or Worships the God of Life, Peace or War. 

**Pirate:** Exemplar is a safe choice for a pirate, perhaps one who Dabbles in Reaping with a pistol. 

**Poisoner:** The Brews Poisons kit is enough to turn any weapons-based character into a poisoner. 

**Psion/Psychic:** A Magician (Enchanter) who Channels Godmind would make a good psion or other psychic. The Psi Focus and Shard feats are a good investment as well. 

**Ranger:** Sylvan or Reaper are  the obvious places to start for a ranger build, depending on whether your focus is melee or ranged combat. For kits, Dabbles in Reaping or Dabbles in Sylvanry would round out the character, as would Charms Animal or (for a smaller animal companion) Binds Familiar. A scout might prefer Exemplifies Speed. 

**Rogue:** The Exemplar has the stealthy Blades in the Dark discipline. 

**Tactician/“Lazylord”:** The brilliant tactician who hangs back from the fray themselves is a classic archetype rarely supported in RPGs. The Golden Trumpet, High Cunning and Born Leader disciplines cater to this style of play, as does the Last Laugh discipline (associated with the Harlequin). A Commander who Exemplifies Intelligence or Exemplifies Charisma should be able to contribute while rarely making an attack themselves. 

**Warlord:** The Commander is a classic warlord. Alternatively, couple Dabbles in Commanding or Exemplifies Charisma with another martial class for a different take on the battlefield leader. 

**Were-Creature:** The Takes Bestial Form kit allows for werewolves, werebears and even werevelociraptors. 

**Wizard/Sorcerer:** The Magician class allows for Evokers, Conjurers and Enchanters. Some sorcerers might work better as Mageblades. 

### Missing Archetypes

Currently, *Orcus* does not have many resources for bards, nature spellcasters, wizards of the other schools of magic, or rogues who focus on striking for massive damage instead of distracting or dueling foes. 

# Classes  

Every character belongs to a class, which they choose at first level. They will remain a member of this class during their entire adventuring career – perhaps up to level 30, the highest level available.     

Since there are ways to get some of the perks of other classes, such as multiclass feats and kits, the original class you chose is sometimes referred to as your “base class”. If you do pick up other classes, you count as a member of those classes, but they will never affect your character as much as your base class does.     

## Tradition  

Each class has one or more traditions, which summarize where that class draws most of its power from.   

**Arcane:** The practitioners of the arcane tradition seek to understand the unexplainable, categorize the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in a systematic way. If your power comes from arcane magic, it is studied or learned.   

**Divine:** The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Material Plane. If your power comes from divine magic, it is granted by the gods or other higher powers.   

**Martial:** Your power comes from strength at arms, experience in battle and training. Martial adventurers have extraordinary abilities, but they are grounded in what is humanly possible.   

**Spirit:** An instinctual connection to  and faith in the world, the cycle of day and night, the turning of the seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey drive the spirit tradition. If your power comes from the spirit tradition, it is drawn from the natural world or the spirits of the world.   

**Phrenic:** The strength of psyche and emotions. The phrenic power source represents the power inherent in all sentient beings, the ability to draw forth the spark of life, that inner fire which gives strength to convictions. In some, it takes the form of extreme dedication, unusual courage, or an unbreakable discipline. But in others, it takes on physical form. Their font of power is so great that they can manipulate the world around them by using it. There are currently no classes of the phrenic tradition, but there are kits and feats that give phrenic powers.

## Role

Each class has one or two roles, which summarize how the class most often contributes in combat.  

**Defender:** A defender soaks up attacks and damage from enemies, punishes enemies for attacking their allies *and* punishes enemies for attacking the defender. The defender forces enemies to make difficult decisions or puts them in a “catch-22”.  

**Striker:** A striker does the most damage or otherwise puts enemies out of action, particularly if they are supported by their allies – but they can be vulnerable if they are left exposed.   

**Leader:** A leader helps their allies do their jobs better in combat, by keeping them alive through healing and defensive bonuses, by increasing their damage output or other contributions, and by enabling them to do things that they couldn’t do before (even if that is as simple as helping them get into position for an attack).  

**Controller:** A controller gives the team control over the battlefield, with crowd control attacks, area denial or impeded movement that limits where and how enemies can move, and negative conditions that reduce what the enemies can do or how effectively they do it.    

##### Table – Roles and Traditions

|             | Controller | Defender  | Leader    | Striker  |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| **Arcane**  | Magician   | Mageblade |           |          |
| **Divine**  |            |           | Crusader  |          |
| **Martial** | Harlequin  | Guardian  | Commander | Exemplar |
| **Spirit**  | Reaper     |           |           | Sylvan   |

## Powers  

Classes follow the default power progression, shown below, unless otherwise mentioned.  

The numbers indicate powers from your class (although note that sometimes you will have the opportunity to select a power not of your class, but filling a class slot).   

“P” indicates a power from your prestige path, so for example at level 11 you will typically gain an encounter attack power from your prestige path. “E” indicates a power from your epic path.   

The appendix has a table that shows which level powers a character of a particular level (following the default progression) can have. This is useful if you are creating a character at higher than 1st level, or if you get confused about which powers can be replaced when.   

When you reach a level that allows you to replace a power, you choose a class attack power you know of that frequency (encounter or daily) and give it up, exchanging it for a power of the level you’re gaining. For example, at level 13 you can give up one of your existing encounter attack powers (e.g., the one you got at level 1) in exchange for a level 13 encounter attack power.   

## Dualclass  

Each class has a “Dualclass” option listed. This is the benefit that a character receives when they take the Dualclass Recruit feat and select that class.   

##### Table – Default Power Progression

| Level | At-will Attack | Encounter Attack | Daily Attack | Utility   | Power Replacements               |  
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------- |  
| 1     | 2              | 1                | 1            |           |                                  |

# Kits  

Kits are another way of customizing your character at first level, if permitted by the Game Master (see “Playing with Kits”, below). They represent another facet to your character that isn’t captured by their race or their class.   

Kits will typically give features a few times during the adventurer tier, usually starting with a feature or two at level 1.   

### Playing with Kits  

Game Masters can approach kits in a few different ways:  

1. Each character gets a kit at first level.   
2. No character gets a kit.   
3. Characters can choose a kit, but they have to give up their feats to do so.   

The third option is the default. 

If you play with the third option, characters must give up all six of their adventurer-tier feats (levels 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) to access one kit’s features and the discipline associated with that kit. Of course, you can always allow player characters to pick up a kit at a later time, as long as they give up the same number of feats.   

### About Kits  

Kits are usually named starting with a verb, like “Dabbles in Wizardry”, “Takes Bestial Form” or “Binds Familiar”.  

“Dabbles in ...” kits are ways to multiclass. “Worships the ...” kits are for worshippers of different gods (what might be called domains).

## Channels Godmind

You can focus your mind to unlock your psychic potential. 

**Psi Focus (Level 1):** You have access to psi focus, a heightened state of mental and emotional clarity, that you can utilize to augment powers with the Augmentable keyword. This psi focus, once used, must refresh, much like how certain monsters have powers that refresh at the beginning of their turn on a successful roll. Psi focus works in the exact same way, but the roll needed to refresh it depends on what kind of power it was last used to augment.  

> #### Psi Focus  
> *Utilizing your phrenic power, you heighten a power or ability beyond what others could fathom.*  
> **At-Will** **Utility** **Feature** (**Free Action**) ● **Phrenic**  
> **Self**   
> **Effect** When using an Augmentable power, you activate the effect noted under the Augment: line.  
> **Special** *Psi focus* refreshes on a 4, 5 and 6 after using it to augment an at-will power, on a 5 and 6 after using it to augment an encounter power, and on a 6 after using it to augment a daily power. You cannot use *psi focus* unless it is recharged.  

**Mantle (Level 5):** Once per encounter you can draw strength from your Mantle. With this powerful connection to your godmind, you can activate *focus surge* or *intensity*.

> #### Focus Surge  
> *You tap into the mental connection between yourself and your Godmind, allowing you to refresh the phrenic energies of either yourself or an ally.*  
> **Mantle** **Utility** **Feature** (**Swift Action**) ● **Phrenic**  
> **Near** burst 5 (10 at level 11, 15 at level 21), you or an ally  
> **Effect** The target can spend one focus surge and recharge their *psi focus*.  

> #### Intensity  
> *You focus on your connection with your Godmind and you become more intensely focused on your next action.*  
> **Mantle** **Utility** **Feature** (**Swift Action**) ● **Phrenic**  
> **Self**   
> **Effect** You gain a +1 bonus to your next attack and damage roll.  

**Focused (Level 10):** You have a number of focus surges equal to your Charisma modifier.  Your focus surges are replenished after a long rest.

You can also perform the meditate action. 

> **MEDITATE: STANDARD ACTION**

**Consume Strength (Level 1):** After an encounter in which you defeated a monster, you can replace one encounter attack power of the monster’s level or lower with an at-will attack power of the monster’s. The power has the Focus tag and uses the ability score of your choice for the attack. 

You can instead or also replace one daily attack power of the monster’s level or lower with an encounter or refresh attack power of the monster’s. The power has the Focus tag and uses the ability score of your choice for the attack. 

If the daily power you replaced had already been expended, you must wait until after your next long rest before using the new power acquired from the monster.

After each long rest, roll 1d6 for each monster power you used that day. On a 1, you lose that monster power. Alternatively, you can choose to lose a monster power after any short or long rest and replace it with the encounter or daily attack power you originally replaced it with.

If the monster could use the power at-will or it was always active, your utility power is an encounter power that lasts until the end of your next round or a daily power
that lasts until the end of the encounter (your choice). If the monster  could use the power once per encounter or on a refresh basis, your utility power is a daily power. 

After each long rest, roll 1d6 for each monster power you used that day. On a 1, you lose that monster power. Alternatively, you can choose to lose a monster power after any short or long rest and replace it with the encounter or daily attack power you originally replaced it with. 

**Level 10:** After an encounter in which you defeated a monster of your level or lower, you can gain an aura of the monster. You can only have one such aura active at any one time. 

In addition, you do not need to defeat a monster to use your Level 1, 5 or 10 powers. The monster can willingly grant you the power(s) instead.

# Disciplines  

A discipline is a set of powers that are thematically related. Characters get access to disciplines from their classes, and sometimes from other sources. Having access to a discipline just means you can choose powers from that discipline when you get to select class powers; it does not give you immediate access to those powers.   

### Key and Secondary Abilities  

Some classes specify that powers selected from class disciplines use different abilities to those specified. If you gain access to the powers of a discipline from another source, this rule does not apply.   

*For example, Arty is an Exemplar (Swashbuckler), which lets him replace a power’s secondary ability with Charisma. He selects the power* deadly thrust *from Blades in the Dark, which identifies Strength as its secondary ability. He uses Charisma in place of Strength when using that ability.*  

*Porthy is a Guardian with the kit “Dabbles in Exemplary Combat”, which gives him access to the Blades in the Dark discipline. However, since his access to the discipline comes from his kit, not his class, he cannot use Charisma in place of Strength when using Blades in the Dark powers.*

## Spells of Ice and Fire  
**Key Ability:** Dexterity  
**Secondary Ability:** Intelligence  

When you first gain a power with the Flux tag, choose an element: lightning, acid, cold, fire or thunder. All powers with the Flux tag have that energy as a tag, and replace any reference to [flux] in the power text with that energy. There are some powers that allow you to change your flux energy, if you take them. You can also change your flux energy when you retrain at a new level. Some classes interact with Flux powers in other ways. 

When a power refers to [flux], it always means your current flux energy, even if you used the power when your flux energy was different. For example, if you conjured a vortex devil, it does damage of your current flux energy not the flux energy you had when you conjured it. 

Note that the Spells of Ice and Fire discipline is dedicated to the cold and fire flux energies. You can use these powers while you have a different flux energy active, but you don’t get any of the special “Cold” or “Fire” riders.

## Tactician  

You have probably graduated from a command school or officer college. You emerged as a trained, disciplined leader, ready to rally the uncontrolled masses. You are not some scholar trained from books. You possess natural, applicable talents, earning the respect that goes along with them.  

### Class Features  

**Coordination (11th level):** Anytime an ally in open range rolls a natural 1, 2, or 3 on an attack roll, you one other ally in open range can shift 2 squares.  

**Tide of War (11th level):** Whenever an ally in open range is staggered, you gain an action point. This can only occur once per ally per encounter. You can spend a swift action to transfer an action point from you to any ally in open range.  

**Take the Opportunity (16th level):** Once per encounter, if you are staggered by an attack, up to five allies in open range can make a basic attack as an immediate (react) action.

**_Requirements:_** One or more of your powers has the Martial tag.  

### Class Features  

**Quick Change Artist (11th level):** As a swift action, you can sheathe a weapon and draw a weapon.  

**Whirling Dervish (11th level):** Instead of spending an action point to take an additional action, you can spend it to use two at-will attack powers that require a standard action, one after the other. They do not have to have the same target.  

**Careful Opportunist (16th level):** When a creature provokes an opportunity attack, you can use an at-will attack power instead of making a basic attack. You must make a melee attack.

# Epic Paths  

At level 21, each player character gets an epic path. This path is on top of their main class, which still gives them some powers, and their prestige path (which stops giving them powers after level 20).   

Traditionally, each epic path has given the player character a way to cheat death, and a way to achieve to immortality. Some of the epic paths included below are more understated, and do not necessarily include these options. Of course, just because a path does not describe a way to achieve immortality, does not mean immortality is out of reach for that character.   

**Table – Epic Paths and Their Requirements**  

| Name            | Description                                                  |  
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |  
| Agent Retriever | You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need. |  
| Master          | You are the single greatest expert on the planet on a specific subject. |  
| Most Dangerous  | No one who hunts you knows your real name. You’re a ghost.   |  
| Respected       | Every soldier that passes you knows your face and gives you the courtesy you have earned. |  
| Team            | It was always, and will always be, about the team.           |  
| Ultimate        | As the legendary fighter, you have too many laurels to count. |  

## Agent Retriever  

Elemental tyrants, the heralds of the gods, the voices between the planets – they all have peculiar needs, and the agents retriever cater to them. You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need.   

**Requirements:** You must have retrieved something of value from another plane of existence, and traded it for a fair price.   

### Immortality  

When your adventuring days come to an end, a number of different fates may await you. What follows is one possibility.   

**Corner of the World’s Eye:** You fade away from public view, but no one can ever confirm your death. Just when people think old age, misadventure or vengeance must have done you in, someone reports spying you in a bazaar, or finding your calling card in the Celestial Vaults, or seeing you for a moment through a pool in the Astral Plane.   

### Class Features  

**Appropriation (Level 21):** Each night, you dream of a magic item. After a long rest, choose any magic item of your level or lower. That magic item appears under your bedroll, ready for use. It disappears when you begin your next long rest.   

The magic item is not created, it is summoned. The GM may want to identify which creature’s possession the magic item was summoned from, and whether there are any hints to your identity when it arrives back in their possession the following day.   

**Interplanar Contingencies (Level 24):** Once per day, when you die, you appear the following round on your initiative count with half your maximum HP and under the slowed condition, in an unoccupied space of your choice at least 6 squares from your dead body. You cannot use any attack powers or recoveries, but you have all the equipment and magic items that were on your person when you died. The equipment and magic items that are actually on your body become shimmering and insubstantial, and cannot be used or picked up.    

When you are adjacent to your corpse, you can use a swift action to merge the old and new bodies. You can now use attack powers and recoveries, although you do not recover any powers or recoveries that were already spent. You lose the slowed condition, but otherwise keep the HP and any conditions, persistent damage, etc., of your new body. Choose which square your merged body appears in.   

**The Economic Flow (Level 30):** You are at the center of a vast trade network. If something is for sale anywhere in the planes, for any price, you can purchase it with a snap of your fingers (free action). The object appears in your hand or on your person, if feasible, or otherwise in the nearest unoccupied space(s) that can hold it. The payment price must be on your person (for example, a pouch of gold pieces on your belt) – it disappears at the same time as the purchased object appears.  

### Powers  

> #### Force Sphere  
> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**Counter Action**) ● **Arcane, Force, Zone**  
> **Near** burst X  
> **Effect** Create a sphere of force in a near burst between 1 and 5 squares in radius (your choice). The sphere is impenetrable by any means.  
> **Maintain Swift**   

## Master  

You are the single greatest expert on the planet on a specific subject. All others bend to your word. Long after you have passed on, your papers and essays will be analyzed for hidden truths previously undiscovered. Your name will be uttered in the same breaths of legends from centuries past. Whatever vocation you have chosen, competitors and publishers will jostle for your contract should you leave your present employment.  

### Class Features  

**Out of Anyone’s League (21st level):** Gain a +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice and a +3 bonus to one skill of your choice.  

**Against the Laws of Physics (24th level):** Pick one your daily utility powers of level 22 or lower. It is now an encounter power.  

Select one additional utility power of any level, from any class.  

**Beyond Impossible (30th level):** Spend a recovery as a swift action but regain no hit points; instead, you gain a +20 power bonus to your next skill roll with the skill you selected with Out of Anyone’s League.  

### Powers  

> #### Pioneer  
> *You’re not tired. You’re just getting warmed up.*  
> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**Free Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Self**   
> **Effect** Spend any number of recoveries to recover that many times your recovery value, and recover all your used encounter powers. You can spend any number of action points until the end of the encounter.  
> **Special** Once you use this power, you cannot recover it except by taking a long rest. 

## Most Dangerous  

No one who hunts you knows your real name. You’re a ghost. Enemies and allies don’t have just one nickname for you; there are several. Few are aware of all your accomplishments. Most of these victories were erased or never directly connected to you. Others you must deny. You career might never have existed at all. Missions that you took were probably illegal, extremely difficult, with no room for failure. Your handle or moniker labels you as one of the most wanted individuals on the planet.  

### Class Features  

**Second Nature (21st level):** You reroll natural 1s and 2s on attack rolls and skill checks, but you must take the second result even if it is another 1 or a 2.  

**Implausible Speed (24th level):** You can use two action points per encounter and if you reach a streak, you gain two action points.  

**Vorpal Ways (30th level):** Once per hit, if you roll the maximum result on any of your initial damage dice, you can roll that die again and add it to your damage total.  

### Powers  

> #### Reputation Earned  
> *Your enemy will soon discover why your name is so feared.*  
> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**Free Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Self**   
> **Effect** You can take an additional standard action and an additional move action on this turn and on your next turn.  

## Respected  

Your uniform weighs you down with the number of medals and honors bestowed. You have reached the point where brandishing such decorations is meaningless. Every soldier that passes you knows your face and gives you the courtesy you have earned. You can sway thousands by your command. Your advice is taken to heart by high priests, archmages, and kings. You don’t win battles. You win wars.   

### Class Features  

**“Try Again and Aim This Time” (21st level):** As an immediate (counter) action, you can allow one ally in line of sight to reroll a missed attack roll.  

**Chess Play (24th level):** When an ally is staggered or reduced to below 0 hit points, as an immediate (react) action, you can grant any other ally in line of sight a standard, a move, and a swift action.  

**Master Tactician (30th level):** As a standard action, you can give one swift action, one move action, and one standard action to be split among up to three allies of your choice in line of sight.  

### Powers  

> #### Not Tolerate Losing  
> *You make every ally in the battle know how you feel about defeat. You make them fear you more than the enemy.*  
> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**Standard Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Near** burst 10, all allies  
> **Effect** The target regains one expended daily or encounter power. The target also gains an action point they must use before the end of their next turn.  

## Team  

It has never been about personal glory or selfish ideals. From the beginning, you have stood tall among others you have treated as equals, others that have returned that honor a hundred times over. You have all lost count how many engagements you have shared, the taken bullets, the close calls. It was always, and will always be, about the team. It’s been years or even decades and none of you will quit until the others do. You each push to be the best and as a result, you all are.  

### Class Features  

**Team Support (21st level):** Spend a recovery as a swift action but regain no hit points; instead, all epic-tier allies in line of sight automatically save against one effect a save can end (except dying) at the start of their next turn.  

**Where the Need is Greatest (24th level):** As a swift action, you can give one of your recoveries to any other epic-tier ally in line of sight. The target ally must use the recovery before the end of the encounter or it is lost.  

**Brothers and Sisters of Blood (30th level):** For every epic-tier ally in line of sight, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to all skill checks and damage rolls (maximum +4).  

### Powers  

> #### For the Sake of the Team  
> *You give an ally the precious time they need complete the task.*  
> **Encounter** **Utility** **26** (**Free Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Near** burst 10, one ally  
> **Effect** The target can take one standard action, one move action, and one swift action before the end of your turn.  

## Ultimate  

As the legendary fighter, you have too many laurels to count. In the old age, you would have been given freedom by the Caesar or awarded a lordship and a manor for your deeds. You have the blood of kings. History is written by the winners and you have seldom seen defeat.  

### Class Features  

**Why Won’t You Die? (21st level** ): Attacks cannot score critical hits against you (take normal damage).  

**Glory of the Fight (24th level):** If you kill a non-mook enemy, you gain a standard, a move, and a swift action that you must use before the end of your next turn.  

**Risky Maneuver (30th level):** As a free action, you can reduce all your defense values to 1. After you are hit three times by enemy attacks, you defenses return to normal and your next attack roll is an automatic critical hit.  

### Powers  

> #### Lasting Image  
> *You are ok with dying, but if this is your time or not, you will be damned if you will let this opponent get away with what it just did.*  
> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**No Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Self**   
> **Trigger** You fail your final death save.  
> **Effect** You regain consciousness and stand up. You cannot die until the end of the encounter. You can take a single action on your turn, losing all other actions except free actions. You can still take immediate actions and opportunity attacks. You gain a +2 bonus to all attack rolls and a +5 bonus to all damage rolls until the end of the encounter. At the end of the encounter, you die.
