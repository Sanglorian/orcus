# Creating a Character

To create an Orcus character, take the following steps:

1. **Choose your class.** Your character’s class will have a greater effect on their powers and capabilities than any other choice you make, so it makes sense to make it first. Some classes require you to make other choices once you select them, such as choosing a talent (a sub-class). 
2. **Choose your ancestry.** Your character’s ancestry is their background, cultural origin, and/or species, depending on the setting. Different settings may have different rules for ancestries. The Outlaw Kingdoms setting splits ancestry into two choices: crux and heritage. 
2. **Choose a feat or a kit.** By default, characters can either choose six feats over the course of their first 10 levels (one at level 1), or choose one kit that provides a package of features over the same 10 levels. Feat paths are provided in the Kits chapter as a guide to feats you may take over your first 10 levels. 
3. **Calculate your ability scores.** You have six ability scores: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Different campaigns will calculate ability scores in different ways, but the default is called “point buy.” 
4. **Choose your trained skills.** Your class will say how many trained skills you have, and provide the list from which you can choose your trained skills. You gain a +5 bonus on all checks for a skill in which you are trained. See the Skills chapter for a full description of skills. 
5. **Choose your powers.** By default, a first-level character chooses two at-will attack powers, one encounter attack power, and one daily attack power. Your class and kit will say which “disciplines” (lists of powers) you can choose your powers from. 
7. **Purchase equipment.** You begin with 100 gold pieces with which to purchase equipment. Characters beginning at later levels start with more gold, and with magic items. 
8. **Calculate all other stats.** You should now have made all the choices you need to make in order to calculate your character’s defenses, attack bonuses, damage bonuses, skill bonuses, hit points, staggered value, recoveries and recovery value, and so on. 

If you create a character at a higher level than 1, the process is similar, except you choose more feats and powers,  and you will also choose a prestige path (if level 11 or higher) and epic path (if level 21 or higher). 

## Archetypes

Here are some example archetypes, and how you might model them in Orcus.

**Assassin/Ninja:** A mystical slayer can be created with the Mageblade, perhaps coupled with the Brews Poisons kit. Embodies Speed is another good choice for a kit. A non-magical assassin or ninja is best done through the Harlequin class. 

**Barbarian/Berserker:** With its focus on Constitution, the Sylvan class is a good start. Any Wild Gift could work for a berserker. For kits, Embodies Strength is a safe choice and even includes some powers that resemble raging. Otherwise a berserker might Eat Monster Hearts, Dabble in Guarding or Worship the God of War, or even Channel Godmind to reflect the influence of a clan spirit or ancestor. 

**Beastmaster:** A Sylvan with the Animal Companion Wild Gift and the Binds Familiar kit can have two animal friends, and turn into a third. 

**Blackguard:** A Guardian who Worships the God of Tyranny or a Priest are good choices. 

**Blue Mage:** A Magician who Eats Monster Hearts is a good model for a blue mage. 

**Cleric:** The Priest is a classic cleric. 

**Demonologist:** Either the Magician (Conjurer) class or the Conjures Fiends kit would be enough to turn a character into a demonologist; taken together they would represent a very strong demonologist archetype. Consider as an alternative taking the Conjures Fiends kit with a different class for a different take on the demonologist: the hellish knight (with the Guardian class), the Harlequin whose fiddle comes from the Devil, or the Mageblade who fights alongside the fiends they conjure. 

**Druid:** The Sylvan has both *wild shape* and an animal companion covered, so it is a good pick for druids.

**Elementalist:** A Mageblade with many powers from the Elemental Flux discipline is a natural elementalist. The Dabbles in Wizardry kit for the Spells of Ice and Fire discipline would add further elemental options, if needed – as would choosing an elemental familiar from Binds Familiar. 

**Fighter (Agile):** The Exemplar or Harlequin.

**Fighter (Heavily Armored):** The Guardian or Commander. 

**Jack of All Trades/Savant/Red Mage:** A Mageblade who takes a lot of Veiled Moon powers is already stealthy, skilled with weapons, and able to cast magic spells. Taking Worships the God of Life or Dabbles in Priesthood on top of that would provide divine power to round out an already versatile character. 

**Magic Dabbler:** Any character could get a strong dose of non-combat magic with the Cantrip Master feat and an investment in incantations. 

**Monk/Martial Artist:** The Martial Training feats, especially the Unarmed Combat feat chain, could turn any weapon-focused character into a martial artist – consider Mageblade for a mystic martial artist, Harlequin for a taunting drunken boxer, Exemplar for an agile combatant, or even Guardian for a sturdy defender. The Channels Godmind kit would add a psychic, meditative element to the build. See the feat path section for ideas for modelling different types of martial artist through feats.

**Mounted Knight:** A Guardian who Charms Animal can pick a horse, giving themselves a powerful and obedient mount and powers that take full advantage of it. 

**Paladin:** The Priest class serves perfectly well for a paladin focused on healing and inspiring their allies. Otherwise, try a Guardian who Dabbles in Commanding or Worships the God of Life, Peace, or War. 

**Pirate:** Exemplar is a safe choice for a pirate, perhaps one who Dabbles in Reaping with a pistol. 

**Poisoner:** The Brews Poisons kit is enough to turn any weapons-based character into a poisoner. 

**Psion/Psychic/Ardent:** A Magician (Enchanter) who Channels Godmind would make a good psion, ardent, or other psychic. The Psi Focus and Shard feats are a good investment as well. 

You can make a soulknife or psychic warrior with Weapon and Shield Shard feats, or a kineticist with the Blast Shard feats. 

**Ranger:** Sylvan or Reaper are  the obvious places to start for a ranger build, depending on whether your focus is melee or ranged combat. For kits, Dabbles in Reaping or Dabbles in Sylvanry would round out the character, as would Charms Animal or (for a smaller animal companion) Binds Familiar. A scout might prefer Embodies Speed. 

**Rogue:** Either a Harlequin or an Exemplar that focuses on the stealthy Blades in the Dark discipline would make a good rogue. 

**Tactician/“Lazylord”:** The brilliant tactician who hangs back from the fray themselves is a classic archetype rarely supported in RPGs. The Angel’s Trumpet and High Cunning disciplines cater to this style of play, as does the Last Laugh discipline (associated with the Harlequin). A Commander who Embodies Intelligence or Embodies Charisma should be able to contribute while rarely making an attack themselves. 

**Warlord:** The Commander is a classic warlord. Alternatively, couple Dabbles in Commanding or Embodies Charisma with another martial class for a different take on the battlefield leader. 

**Were-Creature:** The Takes Bestial Form kit allows for werewolves, werebears, and even werevelociraptors. 

**Wizard/Sorcerer:** The Magician class allows for Evokers, Conjurers, and Enchanters. Some sorcerers might work better as Mageblades.

### Missing Archetypes

Currently, Orcus does not have many resources for bards, nature spellcasters, wizards of the other schools of magic, or rogues who focus on striking for massive damage instead of distracting or dueling foes. 

# Classes  

Every character belongs to a class, which they choose at first level. They will remain a member of this class during their entire adventuring career – perhaps up to level 30, the highest level available.     

Since there are ways to get some of the perks of other classes, such as multiclass feats and kits, the original class you chose is sometimes referred to as your “base class”. If you do pick up other classes, you count as a member of those classes, but they will never affect your character as much as your base class does.     

## Reading Class Descriptions

### Tradition  

Each class has one or more traditions, which summarize where that class draws most of its power from.   

**Arcane:** The practitioners of the arcane tradition seek to understand the unexplainable, categorize the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in a systematic way. If your power comes from arcane magic, it is studied or learned.   

**Divine:** The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Material Plane. If your power comes from divine magic, it is granted by the gods, saints, or other higher powers.   

**Martial:** Your power comes from skill at arms, experience in battle, force of will, and training. Martial adventurers have extraordinary abilities, but they are grounded in what is humanly possible.   

**Phrenic:** The strength of psyche and emotions. The phrenic tradition represents the power inherent in all sentient beings, the ability to draw forth the spark of life, that inner fire which gives strength to convictions. In some, it takes the form of extreme dedication, unusual courage, or an unbreakable discipline. But in others, it takes on physical form. Their font of power is so great that they can manipulate the world around them by using it. There are currently no classes of the phrenic tradition, but there are kits and feats that give phrenic powers.

**Spirit:** An instinctual connection to  and faith in the world, the cycle of day and night, the turning of the seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey drive the spirit tradition. If your power comes from the spirit tradition, it is drawn from the natural world or the spirits of the world.   

### Role

Each class has one or two roles, which summarize how the class most often contributes in combat.  

**Defender:** A defender soaks up attacks and damage from enemies, punishes enemies for attacking their allies *and* punishes enemies for attacking the defender. The defender forces enemies to make difficult decisions or puts them in a “catch-22”.  

Often, defenders control enemies by “marking” them. See the marked condition in the Conditions chapter for more details. 

**Striker:** A striker does the most damage or otherwise puts enemies out of action, particularly if they are supported by their allies – but they can be vulnerable if they are left exposed.   

**Leader:** A leader helps their allies do their jobs better in combat, by keeping them alive through healing and defensive bonuses, by increasing their damage output or other contributions, and by enabling them to do things that they couldn’t do before (even if that is as simple as helping them get into position for an attack).  

**Controller:** A controller gives the team control over the battlefield, with crowd control attacks, area denial or impeded movement that limits where and how enemies can move, and negative conditions that reduce what the enemies can do or how effectively they do it.    

##### Table – Roles and Traditions

|             | Controller | Defender           | Leader    | Striker            |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| **Arcane**  | Magician   | Mageblade          |           |                    |
| **Divine**  |            |                    | Priest    |                    |
| **Martial** | Harlequin  | Guardian, Warrior* | Commander | Exemplar, Warrior* |
| **Spirit**  | Reaper     |                    |           | Sylvan             |

\* The warrior can shift between defender and striker roles.

### Stats

**Hit Points:** A character's hit point maximum is based on their class, level and Constitution score. A character becomes staggered when their current hit points fall to half or less of their maximum. A character's "recovery value" is equal to one quarter of their hit points.   
**Recoveries:** After each long rest, a character has a number of recoveries based on their class and Constitution modifier. When a character has an opportunity to spend a recovery, it is usually in order to heal hit points equal to their recovery value.    
**Defenses:** Each class gives a bonus to one or two defenses. 

See the Combat chapter more details on hit points, recoveries and defenses.

### Proficiency and Training  

**Proficiencies:** A character will gain some combination of armor (including shields), weapon and focus proficiencies from their class. 

A character suffers a -2 penalty to Reflex defense and attack rolls if they wear armor or use a shield they are not proficient with. A character cannot add the proficiency bonus of a weapon to their attack rolls unless they are proficient in that weapon. A character gets no benefit from using a focus unless they are proficient with it.  

See the Equipment chapter for more details. 

**Trained Skills:** A character gains a +5 bonus on skill checks using skills that they are trained in. A character's class gives them training in a certain number of skills; these must be selected from the list of class skills. 

See the Skills chapter for more details. 

### Features

Features are typically unique to each class, and - along with powers - they provide the majority of the class's capabilities. 

Some classes have features that provide additional feats or kits, or which interact with the action points mechanic. You can find more information about these topics in the Feats and Kits chapters, and in the Combat chapter under “Your Turn” (for action points). 

### Powers  

Powers are unique things that characters can do, as an action. Some are limited use; others can be used any number of times. See the Powers chapter for more details. 

**Abilities:** Each class has a primary ability associated with it. That ability is used for most attacks with that class's powers. Each talent (see below) has a secondary ability associated with it. That ability is used whenever a class power uses an ability that is not the primary ability.  

**Power progression:** Classes follow the default power progression, shown below, unless otherwise mentioned. In this book, only the Warrior deviates from the default progression.  

The numbers of powers listed below apply only to your “class powers”: those granted through the Powers entry within your chosen class, or powers from other sources that required you to swap a power from your class for that power. Extra powers from other sources such as cruxes, kits, feats are not counted toward these limits. Powers granted by class features other than the Powers entry are also not counted toward these limits.

“P” indicates a power from your prestige path, so for example at level 11 you will typically gain an encounter attack power from your prestige path. “E” indicates a power from your epic path.   

The appendix has a table that shows which level powers a character of a particular level (following the default progression) can have. This is useful if you are creating a character at higher than 1st level, or if you get confused about which powers can be replaced when.   

When you reach a level that allows you to replace a power, you choose a class attack power you know of that frequency (encounter or daily) and give it up, exchanging it for a power of the level you’re gaining. For example, at level 13 you can give up one of your existing encounter attack powers (for example  the one you got at level 1) in exchange for a level 13 encounter attack power.   

##### Table – Default Power Progression

| Level | At-will Attack | Encounter Attack | Daily Attack | Utility   | Power Replacements               |  
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------- |  
| 1     | 2              | 1                | 1            |           |                                  |

### Talents

Most classes have subclasses called talents. These give an additional feature and set the character's secondary ability (see above).

### Dualclassing and multiclassing  

Dualclassing and multiclassing are two ways for characters of one class to get features and powers from another. 

Each class has a “Dualclass” option listed. This is the benefit that a character receives when they take the Dualclass Recruit feat and select that class. For example, a level 1 Exemplar might take the Dualclass Recruit (Sylvan) feat. They would get the features described under the Sylvan's Dualclass option.   

Some kits are multiclasses. Multiclassing is like dualclassing except you get access to more features and powers. For example, the Dabbles in Reaping class gives you access to the same Reaper features as the Dualclass Recruit (Reaper) feat, plus access to a discipline of powers and more Reaper features at later levels.

### Wild Gift

While under the effects of a *shape of the X* power, you can spend any other *shape of the X* power you have yet to use in order to make an additional Form Attack, over and above the one granted by the using the original *shape of the X* power.  This additional Form Attack may be of either the shape you are currently in or the additional shape you have expended. You may use this option once for each *shape of the X* power you have yet to use.

**Hunter:**  You treat all one-handed melee weapons as having the side weapon property. 

When no ally is closer to an enemy than you are, you get a +1 bonus on attack rolls against that enemy.  You gain this bonus against all enemies who meet these criteria. 

In addition, you also get a bonus feat: Toughness, Two-Weapon Defense, Shield Proficiency or Melee Finesse.  

**Animal Companion:** You gain the service of an animal companion (from the list below). When you use a Red in Tooth and Claw power, you can choose for your animal companion to use the power in your place (it is assumed to always be in *wild shape* form), using your attack bonus and damage die. 

The animal companion obeys the following rules:

*Actions*

* Your companion’s initiative equals your own.
* If you take a move action, the animal companion can take a move action as well.
* You can give up actions to command the animal companion, in which case it gets to take the same actions. For example, you can give up your standard action in order for the animal companion to take a standard action, at your direction. You can also use an immediate action in order for the animal companion to make an opportunity attack or use a counter or reaction (in all three cases, only if eligible to do so). 
* If you are incapacitated or not present, your animal companion gets its full complement of actions without needing to be "commanded". However, it acts like the animal it is: loyally but with limited intelligence. 

*Stats and Combat*

* The animal companion’s level is equal to your own.
* The animal companion’s maximum HP are equal to your staggered value. 
* Your animal companion has no recoveries of its own, but can use yours. 
* Whenever you have the chance to spend a recovery to heal, you can spend a second recovery to heal your animal companion your recovery value. 
* When your animal companion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after your next long rest, at full HP. 
* Your animal companion can contribute to a flank. 

*Other*

* Your animal companion always obeys your commands.
* If you retrain, you can select a different animal companion. 
* The animal companion is an ally of you, and of your allies.
* The animal companion is a bright, sensitive animal, but nonetheless has animal-level intelligence.

# Kits  

Kits are another way of customizing your character at first level, if permitted by the Game Master (see “Playing with Kits”, below). They represent another facet to your character that isn’t captured by their ancestry, class or talent.   

Kits will typically give features a few times during the adventurer tier, usually starting with a feature or two at level 1.   

### Playing with Kits  

By default, characters can choose a kit by giving up the six feats they would normally acquire over the 10 levels of the adventurer tier (levels 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). 

Some Game Masters do not permit characters to take kits at all, and others give all characters a free kit, without them having to give up feats.   

### About Kits  

Kits are usually named starting with a verb, like “Dabbles in Wizardry”, “Takes Bestial Form” or “Binds Familiar”.  

“Dabbles in ...” kits are ways to multiclass. “Worships the ...” kits are for worshippers of different gods (what might be called domains).   

### Redundant Features

If a kit grants you a feat you already possess, or training in a skill in which you are already trained, you may re-train the existing feat or skill using the normal retraining rules. This does not count toward your normal limit of one retraining per level.

### Powers and Associated Disciplines

When a kit has an associated discipline, it means characters can select powers from that discipline as if it were one of their class disciplines. Powers selected in this manner count as class powers. 

Any other powers granted by kits are in addition to the standard allotment of powers (see the Classes chapter) and do not count toward those limits.

## Binds Familiar  

You have bound to your service a familiar, a Tiny animal or creature that aids you and provides companionship.

# Disciplines  

A discipline is a set of powers that are thematically related. Characters get access to disciplines from their classes, and sometimes from other sources like kits. Having access to a discipline just means you can choose powers from that discipline when you get to select class powers; it does not give you immediate access to those powers.   

### Key and Secondary Abilities  

Some classes specify that powers selected from class disciplines may use different abilities to those specified. If you gain access to the powers of a discipline from another source, this rule does not apply.   

*For example, Arty is an Exemplar (Swashbuckler), which lets him replace a power’s secondary ability with Charisma. He selects the power* deadly thrust *from Blades in the Dark, which identifies Strength as its secondary ability. He may use Strength or Charisma when using that ability.*  

*Porthy is a Guardian with the kit “Dabbles in Exemplary Combat”, which gives him access to the Blades in the Dark discipline. However, since his access to the discipline comes from his kit, not his class, he cannot use Charisma in place of Strength when using Blades in the Dark powers.*

## Elemental Flux  
**Key Ability:** Intelligence  
**Secondary Ability:** Constitution  
**Source:** Mageblade (class)

You supplement your attacks with powerful elemental energies. 

**Note:** When you first gain a power with the Flux tag, choose an element: lightning, acid, cold, fire or thunder. All powers with the Flux tag have that energy as a tag, and replace any reference to [flux] in the power text with that energy. There are some powers that allow you to change your Flux energy, if you take them. You can also change your Flux energy when you retrain at a new level. Some classes interact with Flux powers in other ways. 

When a power refers to [flux], it always means your current flux energy, even if you used the power when your flux energy was different. For example, if you conjured a vortex devil, it does damage of your current flux energy not the flux energy you had when you conjured it.

## Spells of Ice and Fire  
**Key Ability:** Dexterity  
**Secondary Ability:** Intelligence  
**Source:** Magician (class)

You control elemental ice and fire.

**Note:** When you first gain a power with the Flux tag, choose an element: lightning, acid, cold, fire or thunder. All powers with the Flux tag have that energy as a tag, and replace any reference to [flux] in the power text with that energy. There are some powers that allow you to change your flux energy, if you take them. You can also change your flux energy when you retrain at a new level. Some classes interact with Flux powers in other ways. 

When a power refers to [flux], it always means your current flux energy, even if you used the power when your flux energy was different. For example, if you conjured a vortex devil, it does damage of your current flux energy not the flux energy you had when you conjured it. 

Note that the Spells of Ice and Fire discipline is dedicated to the cold and fire flux energies. You can use these powers while you have a different flux energy active, but you don’t get any of the special “Cold” or “Fire” riders.

# Epic Paths  

At level 21, each player character gets an epic path. This path is on top of their main class, which still gives them some powers, and their prestige path (which stops giving them powers after level 20). Like prestige path powers, powers granted by epic paths are in addition to those granted you a character’s class and do not count towards total class powers available.  

Traditionally, each epic path has given the player character a way to cheat death, and a way to achieve to immortality. Some of the epic paths included below are more understated, and do not necessarily include these options. Of course, just because a path does not describe a way to achieve immortality, does not mean immortality is out of reach for that character.   

**Table – Epic Paths and Their Requirements**  

| Name            | Description                                                  |  
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |  
| Agent Retriever | You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need. |  
| Master          | You are the single greatest expert on the planet on a specific subject. |  
| Most Dangerous  | No one who hunts you knows your real name. You’re a ghost.   |  
| Respected       | Every soldier that passes you knows your face and gives you the courtesy you have earned. |  
| Team            | It was always, and will always be, about the team.           |  
| Ultimate        | As the legendary fighter, you have too many laurels to count. |  

## Agent Retriever  

Elemental tyrants, the heralds of the gods, the voices between the planets – they all have peculiar needs, and the agents retriever cater to them. You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need.   

**Requirements:** You must have retrieved something of value from another plane of existence, and traded it for a fair price.   

### Immortality  

When your adventuring days come to an end, a number of different fates may await you. What follows is one possibility.   

**Corner of the World’s Eye:** You fade away from public view, but no one can ever confirm your death. Just when people think old age, misadventure or vengeance must have done you in, someone reports spying you in a bazaar, or finding your calling card in the Celestial Vaults, or seeing you for a moment through a pool in the Astral Plane.   

### Class Features  

**Appropriation (Level 21):** Each night, you dream of a magic item. After a long rest, choose any magic item of your level or lower. That magic item appears under your bedroll, ready for use. It disappears when you begin your next long rest.   

The magic item is not created, it is summoned. The GM may want to identify which creature’s possession the magic item was summoned from, and whether there are any hints to your identity when it arrives back in their possession the following day.   

**Interplanar Contingencies (Level 24):** Once per day, when you die, you appear the following round on your initiative count with half your maximum HP and under the slowed condition, in an unoccupied space of your choice at least 6 squares from your dead body. You cannot use any attack powers or recoveries, but you can make basic attacks and you have all the equipment and magic items that were on your person when you died. The equipment and magic items that are actually on your body become shimmering and insubstantial, and cannot be used or picked up.    

When you are adjacent to your corpse, you can use a swift action to merge the old and new bodies. You can now use attack powers and recoveries, although you do not recover any powers or recoveries that were already spent. You lose the slowed condition, but otherwise keep the HP and any conditions, persistent damage, etc., of your new body. Choose which square your merged body appears in.   

**The Economic Flow (Level 30):** You are at the center of a vast trade network. If something is for sale anywhere in the planes, for any price, you can purchase it with a snap of your fingers (free action). The object appears in your hand or on your person, if feasible, or otherwise in the nearest unoccupied space(s) that can hold it. The payment price must be on your person (for example, a pouch of gold pieces on your belt) – it disappears at the same time as the purchased object appears.  

### Power  

> #### Force Sphere  
> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**Counter Action**) ● **Arcane, Force, Zone**  
> **Near** burst X  
> **Effect** Create a sphere of force in a near burst between 1 and 5 squares in radius (your choice). The sphere is impenetrable by any means. The zone persists until the end of your next turn.  
> **Maintain Swift** The zone persists until the end of your next turn.  

## Master  

You are the single greatest expert on the planet on a specific subject. All others bend to your word. Long after you have passed on, your papers and essays will be analyzed for hidden truths previously undiscovered. Your name will be uttered in the same breaths of legends from centuries past. Whatever vocation you have chosen, competitors and publishers will jostle for your contract should you leave your present employment.  

### Class Features  

**Out of Anyone’s League (21st level):** Gain a +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice and a +3 bonus to one skill of your choice.

### Power

> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**Free Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Self**   
> **Effect** You heal damage equal to double your recovery value. You recover all your used encounter powers.  
> **Special** Once you use this power, you cannot recover it except by taking a long rest. 

## Most Dangerous  

No one who hunts you knows your real name. You’re a ghost. Enemies and allies don’t have just one nickname for you; there are several. Few are aware of all your accomplishments. Most of these victories were erased or never directly connected to you. Others you must deny. You career might never have existed at all. Missions that you took were probably illegal, extremely difficult, with no room for failure. Your handle or moniker labels you as one of the most wanted individuals on the planet.  

### Class Features  

**Second Nature (21st level):** You reroll natural 1s and 2s on attack rolls and skill checks, but you must take the second result even if it is another 1 or a 2.

### Power

> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**Free Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Self**   
> **Effect** You gain two action points.

## Respected  

Your uniform weighs you down with the number of medals and honors bestowed. You have reached the point where brandishing such decorations is meaningless. Every soldier that passes you knows your face and gives you the courtesy you have earned. You can sway thousands by your command. Your advice is taken to heart by high priests, archmages, and kings. You don’t win battles. You win wars.   

### Class Features  

**“Try Again and Aim This Time” (21st level):** The first time in an encounter that an ally within line of sight misses on an attack, they may reroll their attack roll.

### Power

> *You make every ally in the battle know how you feel about defeat. You make them fear you more than the enemy.*  
> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**Standard Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Near** burst 10, all allies  
> **Effect** The target regains one expended encounter power.

## Team  

It has never been about personal glory or selfish ideals. From the beginning, you have stood tall among others you have treated as equals, others that have returned that honor a hundred times over. You have all lost count how many engagements you have shared, the taken bullets, the close calls. It was always, and will always be, about the team. It’s been years or even decades and none of you will quit until the others do. You each push to be the best and as a result, you all are.  

### Class Features  

**Team Support (21st level):** Each time you spend a recovery for any purpose, choose one ally within line of sight. The ally immediately saves against one effect a save can end (except dying). 

**Where the Need is Greatest (24th level):** As a swift action, choose an ally (or yourself). The target loses one recovery. If you do so, choose an ally (or yourself). The target gains one recovery. 

**Brothers and Sisters of Blood (30th level):** For every epic-tier ally in line of sight, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to all skill checks and damage rolls (maximum +4).  

### Power  

> #### For the Sake of the Team  
> *You give an ally the precious time they need complete the task.*  
> **Encounter** **Utility** **26** (**Free Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Near** burst 10, one ally  
> **Effect** The target takes one standard action. 

## Ultimate  

As the legendary fighter, you have too many laurels to count. In the old age, you would have been given freedom by the Caesar or awarded a lordship and a manor for your deeds. You have the blood of kings. History is written by the winners and you have seldom seen defeat.  

### Class Features  

**Why Won’t You Die? (21st level):** Attacks cannot score critical hits against you (take normal damage).  

**Glory of the Fight (24th level):** If you kill a non-mook enemy, you gain a +4 power bonus on your next attack roll.

### Power  

> #### Lasting Image

> **Daily** **Utility** **26** (**No Action**) ● **Martial**  
> **Self**   
> **Trigger** You begin dying.  
> **Effect** You regain consciousness and stand up. You can take a single action on your turn, losing all other actions except free actions.

You cannot be healed until the end of the encounter, and do not make death saves until then. At the end of the encounter, you fall unconscious and begin making death saves as normal.
