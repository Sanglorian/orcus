## Pools of Chaos

*Level 3*

Pools of chaos are composed of raw, seething primal chaos. Proximity to a pool of chaos may bring about strange changes over time, while direct contact with the raw chaos is even quicker. 

**Changes to inanimate matter:** While immediate contact with a pit of chaos is instantly transformative, even near proximity to a pit will slowly transform objects and creatures. Objects (or portions of objects) within 20 squares of a pit of chaos have a chance of alteration as follows:

* 50 percent chance on contact, and each round after
* 10 percent chance after the first hour
* 5 percent chance after the first 24 hours
* 5 percent chance after the first month
* 5 percent chance after the first year
* 5 percent chance each year thereafter

These percentage chances are not cumulative.

When something is changed, half the time its material changes and the other half of the time its shape or texture changes. Use the Material Changes and Shape/Texture Changes tables to determine the specific type of change.

Generally these alterations cannot be reversed or repaired except through the use of an art.

**Changes to creatures:** Living creatures suffer a +7 attack vs Fortitude each time the following occurs:

*Contact:*

* On contact, and each round after

*After spending time within 20 squares of a pit of chaos:*

* After the first hour
* After the first 24 hours
* After the first month
* After the first year
* After each year thereafter

On a hit, use the *Physical Changes* table to determine the specific type of change.

Generally these alterations cannot be reversed or repaired except through the use of an incantation.

**Spellcasting near a pool of chaos:** Using incantations or arcane powers within 20 squares of a pit of chaos is a risky proposition. To successfully cast the spell the caster must attempt an Arcana check (DC 10 plus half the level of the power or incantation). If this check fails, roll on the Spellcasting Changes table to determine how the spell’s effect is changed. Some results have multiple entries – choose the first one which applies.

##### Table – Spellcasting Changes

| d%    | Change to the Spell Effect                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-20 | Spell target(s) or those within the area of effect are affected as if they made contact with a pool of chaos. |
| 21-50 | Near and Far spells have a random area within range (and random targets within that area where relevant). Melee and ranged spells choose targets randomly from those within range. Spells with a range of self instead target a random creature within 6 squares. |
| 51-70 | Damage-inflicting spells heal instead of harm. Penalties become bonuses and vice versa. Effects become their opposites, if applicable. |
| 71-85 | Spell energy goes wild, becoming a random spell of the same level, keeping target the same if possible. |
| 86-00 | Spell energy surges uncontrollably, exploding in a Near burst 10. +7 attack vs Reflex; on a hit, 1d12+3 force damage. |
