## Ancestry Traits  

The description of each ancestry includes traits that are common to members of that ancestry. The following entries appear among the traits of most ancestries.  

### Size  

Characters of most ancestries are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few ancestries are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall).   

### Source and Type

Each ancestry has a source, which describes whether it comes from the natural world or another plane of existence, and a type, which describes the body shape and physiology of the ancestry. These are described in more detail in the Monster Statistics chapter. 

Some ancestries have a tag, which is another form of categorization. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them.  

### Speed  

Your speed determines how far you can move.  

### Languages  

By virtue of your ancestry, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.  

### Other Features and Powers

Most ancestries provide other benefits, which may include powers. Powers granted by your ancestry never count toward your total class powers available.

## Human  

**Medium natural humanoid**

It's hard to make generalizations about humans.  

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall.   

Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Giant curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

Instead of giving humans the Dabbler feature, GMs may want to offer them the *true grit* power instead – especially if they are taking a class that does not have at-will attack powers. However, GMs should note that *true grit* is unusually powerful for an ancestry power and it overlaps with the elf's *careful focus* power.

# Designing Your Own Ancestries  

While Orcus provides a number of ancestries by default, you can also design your own by following the steps below. 

## Ability Score Increases  

Pick three ability scores. A player that chooses that ancestry can choose two of the three abilities to receive a +2 bonus to.  

## Skill Bonuses  

Pick two skills. The ancestry grants a +2 ancestry bonus to each skill.  

## Size, Speed  

By default, ancestries are Medium with a speed of 6. Other options include:  

* Small, speed 5.  
* Small, speed 6.   
* Medium, speed 5, your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.  

Some ancestries may also grant other forms of movement, such as climb or  swim, usually with a speed equal to or less than their normal speed. If you give an ancestry an additional movement type, reduce their number of minor traits (see below) to one.

## Language  

Common, plus one or two others that make sense.   

## Color Traits  

Choose none, or as many as you like. Adding a couple of color traits to an ancestry can be a way to compensate for underwhelming traits in other areas, like a speed of 5 or one of the weaker minor traits.   

As well as the color traits described here, feel free to come up with your own. A good color trait is interesting enough to be worth noting, but has a minor effect on the game. 

**Additional Language:** Members of this ancestry know an additional language, either one of their player's choice or one shared by all members of the ancestry. 

**Cosmic Ancestry:** You have the cosmic source. 

**Fey Ancestry:** You have the fey source.  

**Hold Breath:** +5 ancestry bonus to Endure checks to hold your breath.  

**Ice Stride:** Ice, snow or slurry are not difficult terrain for you.  

**Low-Light Vision:** You can see in dim light as if it were bright light.  

**Machine Ancestry:** You have the automaton type and the construct tag.  

**Reptile Ancestry:** You have the reptile tag.  

**Shake Off X:** +5 ancestry bonus on saving throws against powers and effects with the Poison, Psychic, Fear, Illusion or Charm tag.   

**Stone Stride:** Broken ground, uneven stone or rubble are not difficult terrain for you.  

**Swamp Stride:** Mud, marsh and shallows are not difficult terrain for you.  

**Tongue of Salt and Spray:** You can speak with riverine and ocean-going mammals and water birds.

**Trance:** You don't need to sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. Your 4-hour trance has the same effect as a 6-hour long rest.  

**Undead Ancestry:** You have the undead tag.  

**Web Stride:** Webs, like those from a spider, are not difficult terrain for you.  

**Woodland Stride:** Shrubbery, trees or plants are not difficult terrain for you.  

## Minor Traits  

By default, each ancestry gets two.   

**Burrower:** You have a burrow speed of 1 square. Your burrow cannot extend too far or it risks caving in; you must double back to the surface after burrowing for 5 squares.   

**Combined Heritage:** For the purpose of taking feats, you count as two ancestries of your choice.   

**Darkvision:** You can see in darkness or dim light as if it were bright light.

**Eager Charge:** Your speed increases by +2 when you charge.   

**Focus Proficiency:** You have proficiency with orbs, staffs and wands.   

**Go for the Jugular:** +1 ancestry bonus on attacks against staggered enemies.   

**Heart of Stone:** You do not make death saving throws. You still die if reduced to negative hit points equal to your maximum hit points.  

While unconscious, you do not need to breathe nor do you get hungrier or thirstier.

**Heart of the Legion:** When adjacent to at least two allies, you receive a +1 power bonus to all defenses.

**Hide in a Flash:** When you make an initiative check, if you are in cover or concealment, you can make a Stealth check to hide (takes no action).   

**Injured Rage:** +1 ancestry bonus on attack rolls while staggered.   

**Just Keep Going:** When you make Endure checks as part of a group check or extended challenge, or to Aid Another, roll twice and take the higher result.   

**Light Shield Proficiency:** You have proficiency with light shields.  

**Made of Metal:** You do not make death saving throws. You still die if reduced to negative hit points equal to your maximum hit points. 

You do not sleep, breathe, eat or drink.

**Magic Sight:** You can, to a range of 12 squares, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

**Maze Mind:** When you are the target of an attack with the Psychic tag, the attacker is rattled (save ends).

**Minor Magics:** You know one power from the Cantrips discipline. 

**Powerful Build:** You have a +2 ancestry bonus to checks to escape a grapple. When you are the target of any attack or power that has a different effect based on the target’s size, you may choose to be treated as size Large instead of size Medium for the purposes of that attack.   

**Natural Weapon – X:** You are proficient with a martial weapon, such as your claws, bite, horns or tail. The natural weapon has the statistics of a martial weapon.

**Resistance to X:** Resistance to one or two types of damage 5 + half your level.  

**Shared Mind:** You gain telepathy 5, which means you can communicate mentally with creatures you can see that are within 5 squares of you. The creature must be able to speak at least one language; once you have begun the communication they can “speak” back to you if they wish. Your telepathy does not allow you to read the creature’s  thoughts or influence them other than in the same manner as ordinary  verbal communication.  

**Skill Training:** You are trained in an extra skill of your choice.  

**Slimy Coating:** After each short rest you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (2 + Con at level 11, 5 + Con at level 21).

**Speedy:** +1 to your base walking speed.  

**Under-Developed Wings:** You have a fly speed of 6, but you fall at the end of your turn and your maximum altitude is 1.   

**Unmoved:** You may reduce any unwilling movement you are subject to by 1 square. When you would fall prone as the result of an attack, make a saving throw – on a success, you do not fall.   

**Versatile Stride:** You ignore difficult terrain.   

**Vigor:** Add your Constitution modifier to your recovery value.   

**Wandering Charge:** When you charge, you do not need to move in a straight line.

**X Defense:** +1 ancestry bonus to Fortitude, Reflex or Will defense.   

**X Guidance:** Allies within 10 receive a +1 ancestry bonus to a particular skill.   

**X Weapon Proficiency:** You have proficiency with martial weapons in a particular weapon group.   

## Power  

Each ancestry also gets one power. In some cases, they may choose this power from a list of two or more options. 

Choose powers from an existing ancestry, or design your own. 

# Combat Maneuvers

The maneuvers introduced here are available to all characters, but they are only usable where they make sense in the fiction. In particular, the *damage power source*, *repel* and *lure* powers are intended to be used only where an enemy could lose access to its powers (for example, a gem in its forehead is the source of its energy ray), be repulsed by something (perhaps a clove of garlic brandished at a vampire) or attracted to something (like a tyrannosaurus drawn to a dead cow).

> #### Damage Power Source  
>
> **At-Will** **Attack**  (**Standard Action**) ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Melee or Ranged** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack** Strength or Dexterity vs Fortitude or Reflex (whichever is higher)  
> **Hit** Choose one of the target’s powers. They cannot use it until it refreshes (roll of 5 or 6 required).

> #### Ignite  
>
> **At-Will** **Attack**  (**Standard Action**) ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Melee or Ranged** weapon, one creature

> **Hit** The target is pulled 5 squares and is immobile (save ends). The target gets a new save each time it is hit by an attack.  
> **Effect** The target is immune to the *lure* power until the end of the encounter.  
> **Special** Depending on the susceptibility of the creature, the *lure* might be deployed in a different space to the user.  

> #### Overrun  
>
> **At-Will** **Attack**  (**Move Action**) ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Effect** Move up to your speed. Make a secondary attack each time you attempt to enter an enemy’s space. 
> *Secondary Attack:* Strength vs Fortitude; on a hit, push the target 1 square and you successfully enter their space; on a miss, you provoke an opportunity attack from the target, fail to enter their space, and your movement ends.

> #### Repel  
>
> **At-Will** **Attack**  (**Standard Action**) ● **Focus**  
> **Near** burst 2, any vulnerable creatures  
> **Attack** Wisdom or Charisma vs Will  
> **Hit** The target is pushed their speed and is immobile until the end of your next turn.  
> **Effect** The target is immune to the *repel* power until the end of the encounter.  
> **Special** Depending on the vulnerability of the creature, the repellant might be deployed in a different space to the user.  

> #### Sunder  
>
> **At-Will** **Attack**  (**Standard Action**) ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Melee** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack** Strength or Dexterity vs Reflex  
> **Hit** Choose an item in the possession of the creature. Any bonuses it gives the user are reduced by 1 (cumulative) until the user takes a long rest.  
> **Effect** You provoke an opportunity attack from the target.

## Randomly Generating a Magic Item

### Bracelet of Friends

*Level 14*

This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon it when created. The  owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to one charm.  (This designation takes a standard action, but once done it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is  grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is  called to the spot (a standard action) along with his or her gear, as  long as the owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is calling, and the *bracelet of friends* only  functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it  disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. 

### Decanter of Endless Water

*Level 9*

If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask (a swift action) and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type as well as the volume and velocity.

### Deck of Illusions

*Level 7*

This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20-1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use a standard action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 6 squares.

An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 24 squares of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 6 squares of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who visually inspects the creature (a standard action) identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Perception check. The creature then appears translucent.

The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

### Efficient Quiver

*Level 3*

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.

### Eyes of Minute Seeing

*Level 4*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have a +2 enhancement bonus to checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.

### Eyes of the Eagle

*Level 8*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have a +2 enhancement bonus on Perception checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

### Eversmoking Bottle

*Level 6*

Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle.

**Item Power** (standard, daily) ● **Fire, Zone**   
Near burst 6; thick smoke makes everything in the zone heavily obscured until five minutes have passed or as soon as there is strong wind.  

### Folding Boat  

*Level 16*  

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use a standard action to speak it.  

One command word causes the box to unfold into a skiff (see the Vehicles chapter). 

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship  (see the Vehicles chapter).

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.  

The third command word causes the *folding boat* to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.  

### Goggles of Night

*Level 1*

While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 12 squares. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 12 squares.

### Hand of the Mage

*Level 3*

This mummified elf hand allows you to use a cantrip (chosen by the GM from the Cantrips discipline).

### Horseshoes of a Zephyr  

*Level 9*  

When these four iron horseshoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to fly at its walk speed (hover, maximum altitude 1). 

In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.  

### Horseshoes of Speed  

*Level 10*  

When these four iron horseshoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature’s walking speed by 6.  

### Immovable Rod  

*Level 8*  

This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use a swift action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses a swift action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Athletics check, moving the fixed rod up to 2 squares on a success.  

### Instant Fortress  

*Level 24*  

You can use a standard action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.  

The fortress is a square tower, 4 squares on a side and 6 squares high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a swift action. It is immune to magical effects that would open it or make it easier to open.  

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance 15 to all other damage.   

### Lantern of Revealing

*Level 10*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 6-square radius and dim light for an additional 6 squares. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's bright light. You can use a swift action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 1-square radius.

### Marvelous Pigments

*Level 17*

These pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.

Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 100 squares, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features – such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons up to 2 squares high. It takes 10 minutes to cover 4 squares.

When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.

### Necrosis Cube

*Level 7*

**Regenesis:** When you spend a recovery, you heal additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.  
*Level 11:* Your Wisdom modifier +2.  
*Level 21:* Your Wisdom modifier +5.  

**Sustenance**: You do not need to eat or drink while carrying the cube. You only need two hours sleep for a long rest. 

**Healing Light** (reaction, encounter) ● **Healing**
A creature within 6 squares uses an arcane power: You can spend a recovery to heal up to your recovery value.  

### Pipes of the Sewers

*Level 4*

In addition to playing these pipes as a normal musical instrument, you can use them to produce rodent-like sounds. While doing so, you can communicate with rats (including giant rats) and they will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

### Portable Hole  

*Level 9*  

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  

You can use a standard action to unfold a *portable hole* and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the *portable hole* creates an extradimensional hole 2 squares deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open *portable hole* can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  

You can use a standard action to close a *portable hole* by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Athletics check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 1 square of the *portable hole* or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed *portable hole* can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.  

Placing a *portable hole* inside another *portable hole*, or an extradimensional space created by another item, instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 2 squares of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.  

### Robe of Eyes

*Level 10*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

- The robe lets you see in all directions.
- You have darkvision out to a range of 24 squares.
- You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 24 squares.

The eyes on the robe can't be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.

If you are hit by an attack with the radiant tag, you are dazed (save ends). 

### Rope of Climbing

*Level 2*

A 60-foot-long *rope of climbing* is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 2 squares (10 feet) per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.

A *rope of climbing* can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied but lowers the DC of Athletics checks to climb with it by 5. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked. 

### Satchel of Useful Items

*Level 7*

This appears to be an unremarkable satchel, but a character who dons it  notes that it is adorned with small cloth patches of various shapes.  Only the wearer of the robe can recognize these patches for  what items they become, and detach them. One patch can be detached as a swift action. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as  indicated below. 

A newly created robe of useful items always has two  each of the following patches:

- Dagger
- Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
- Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror)
- Pole (10-foot length)
- Hempen rope (50-foot coil)
- Sack

In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the  number of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below  to determine its nature.

| 76-83  | Incantation scroll (roll 1d6 to determine level)             |
| 84-90  | A dog                                                        |
| 91-96  | Window (2 ft. by 4 ft., up to 2 ft. deep)                    |
| 97-100 | Portable ram                                                 |

Multiple items of the same kind are permissible. Once removed, a patch cannot be replaced.

### Script of Faithfulness

*Level 6*

This item is a small box containing religious scripture. Anyone who holds the item is aware of any action or  item that could adversely affect their alignment and their standing with their deity, including magical effects. The holder acquires this information prior to performing such an action or becoming  associated with such an item if they take a moment to contemplate the  act.

### Spiritlink Charm

*Level 3*

On a critical hit, your companion does additional damage equal to 1d6 times by the bonus of an enchanted weapon or focus that you wield. For example, if you wield a *+3 longsword*, your companion does +3d6 damage on a critical hit. 

### Stone of Alarm

*Level 1*

This stone cube, when given the command word, affixes itself to any object. If that object is touched thereafter by  anyone who does not first speak that same command word, the stone emits a piercing screech for 1 hour that can be heard up to a quarter-mile away (assuming no intervening barriers).

### Sustaining Spoon

*Level 2*

This unremarkable eating utensil is typically fashioned from horn. If  the spoon is placed in an empty container the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although this substance has a flavor similar to that of  warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing and contains everything  necessary to sustain any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous  creature. The spoon can produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to  four humans.

## Consumable Items

## Poisons  

Poisons are “masterwork consumables”, which just means they cost double that of a normal consumable item of their level.

Poisons can either be used in combat as powers, or if the poisoner gets an opportunity to expose the target to the poison more extensively (by feeding it to them, storing it in a container that the target opens, placing it on their clothes, etc.) then the target can suffer a more serious effect.

## Hirelings and Companions

You can typically purchase an animal or other creature for two times the cost of an enchanted item of the same level, if it is a standard monster. The multiplier is four for an elite monster and eight for a boss monster. If the creature gives special utility, for example it can fly at a low level, it typically costs twice again what it would normally cost. 

# Backgrounds  

Backgrounds describe training or environments your character experienced before becoming an adventurer. Backgrounds appear in this book because they are an optional rule.

Backgrounds allow you to customize your character based on their life before adventuring.  

Your character’s background can help you learn or portray more about their personality while also suggesting what sorts of things they’re likely to know. Consider what events set your character on their path to the life of an adventurer and how those circumstances relate to their background.  

When you select a background, you can select **one** of the following benefits (unless another option is specified in the background):  

1. You learn a new language that the GM agrees seems related to that background.  
2. You add one of the skills associated with the background to your list of class skills.  
3. You get a +2 bonus to one of the skills associated with the background.

# Arts

Arts are things that your character can do over an extended period of time – at least minutes, up to weeks or months in the case of the most elaborate arts. You must learn an art, which typically costs money (the “cost to learn”) and takes time. Then using the art requires you to spend the time specified under its “completion time” and expending the money or other resources listed under “component cost”.

Most arts are associated with a skill. You must be trained in that skill to learn that art.

## Types of Art

There are two main types of art: practices and incantations. Practices are often non-magical, although they can involve feats that go beyond ordinary human abilities into the realm of legend. Incantations are more explicitly magical – they are spell-like practices, although they can be learned and used (“cast”) by characters who are not otherwise spellcasters. 

There are special rules relating to incantations, described below. 

## Practices

Practices typically take 8 to 24 hours to learn (8 for heroic-tier arts, 16 for prestige-tier and 24 for epic-tier).

### Types of Practice

* Schema: Schemas allow you to make, brew or craft items. Often, a schema practice unlocks the ability to learn many different schemas. For example, the Craft Trap practice encompasses one schema for each trap. 
* Lesson: Lessons allow you to teach an ability to another. 
* Treatment: Treatments are curative practices. 
* Information: Information practices tell you something about yourself or the world. 
* Trick: Tricks are a miscellaneous category. 
* Interaction: Interaction practices involve talking to or otherwise engaging with other creatures. 

## Incantations  

Spell-like arts are called incantations. Incantations can be learned and used (“cast”) by characters who are not spellcasters. Characters who know the correct gestures and phrases for an incantation can achieve powerful magic effects.   

Incantations have drawbacks: They’re time-consuming to cast, and success is not always assured. They are often expensive, and some incantations work only under certain specific conditions, such as during a full moon.  

Sometimes, an incantation that is incorrectly cast reverses itself on the caster, explodes with a cascade of magical energy, or weakens the barrier between worlds, enabling hostile outsiders to emerge onto the Material Plane.  

Incantations provide a useful way to introduce powerful magical effects in a lower-level game under controlled conditions. PCs will still use spells rather than expensive, risky incantations whenever they can. Incantations are also more specific than spells, so the GM can introduce them into the game without worrying that they’ll spread beyond the immediate situation.

### Discovering Incantations

Obscure tomes and spellbooks filled with mystical ramblings, descriptions of magic theory, ordinary arcane spells, and utterly useless or incomprehensible magical writing often hide the instructions for performing incantations. In those dusty volumes, diligent readers can find incantations with real power—magical recipes that provide step-by-step instructions for achieving a powerful effect.  

Incantations can be recorded in a spellbook, even if the user does not normally use a spellbook. A spellbook fits one level of incantation per page (so a level 9 incantation takes up 9 pages). Copying an incantation from one book to another costs the same amount as buying the incantation, and takes eight, 16 or 24 hours (for adventurer-tier, prestige-tier and epic-tier incantations respectively).  

### Variant: Failed Incantations  

For one reason or another, a GM may decide that an incantation has failed or backfired. Some ideas for how it could backfire are given below:   

**Attack:** A creature is called from elsewhere to battle the caster (and often any bystanders and secondary casters).   

**Augment:** The incantation was supposed to weaken or destroy its target, but it makes the target more powerful instead. An incantation that deals damage might heal its target or cause it to grow in power, for example.  

**Betrayal:** The incantation seemingly succeeds, but the subject of the incantation (or, in rare cases, the caster) undergoes a dramatic alignment change. Over the next 1d6 minutes, the subject’s alignment becomes the extreme opposite of what it was previously (for instance, lawful good becomes chaotic evil; an unaligned subject randomly becomes lawful good, evil, good, or chaotic evil). The subject generally tries to keep its new outlook a secret.  

**Damage:** Either the caster or the target takes damage as the consequence of failure.  

**Death:** Someone—usually the caster or the target—dies. Some incantations allow a saving throw to avoid this consequence of failure.  

**Delusion:** The caster believes the incantation had the desired effect, but in fact it had no effect or a very different one.  

**Falsehood:** The incantation (typically a divination) delivers false results to the caster, but the caster believes the results are true.  

**Mirrorcast:** The incantation has the opposite effect of what was intended.  

**Reversal:** The incantation affects the caster rather than the intended target.  

### Types of Incantation  

* Abjuration   
* Curative   
* Illusion  
* Divination  
* Practical   
* Transportation  
* Crafting   
* Conjuration   
* Scrying  

## Using an Art  

### Interrupting Arts  

Arts take a long time to use. If the art is interrupted, you have to start again but none of the components are used up.   

### Taking 10  

You cannot take 10 on any skill checks associated with an art.   

### Level  

You must be the same or higher level than an art to use it.  

## Component Cost  

Most arts require materials. Others require the user to spend a recovery. Unless otherwise mentioned, this is just like spending a recovery to heal HP, except the user regains no HP.    

## Secondary Users  

Arts allow for additional participants, unless otherwise mentioned. They must be physically present at the art, but do not have to have the relevant skill. They can pay the recovery cost of an art, if any. Secondary users can also help the primary user succeed on skill checks (if any are required) by means of the Aid Another action.   

## Rules Variant: Gated Arts

In this rules variant, you must have a relevant feat before you can learn arts. Add these feats to the list of feats that characters can learn through Arcane Training or Magical Training. 

### Incantation Caster

**Benefit:** You can learn and use Arcana, Religion, Heal and Nature incantations. You can use these incantations even if you are not trained in the relevant skill. 

### Practical Arts

**Benefit:** You can learn and use practices. However, you must be trained in the relevant skill (where applicable) to learn a practice.   

## Sample Arts

Arts are sorted by skill.

## Arcana  

### Alarm  

Level 1 Abjuration Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** A tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You ward an area in a two-square burst to alert you when creatures enter without your permission. When you cast *alarm*, select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature enters the incantation’s area without speaking the password, alarm sends your choice of a mental alert or an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell. Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against your Arcana modifier +10 or trigger the incantation when moving into the area.

*Arcana check:* With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you can specify criteria for which creatures sound the *alarm* - for instance, orcs or masked people.  

### Floating Disk  

Level 1 Crafting Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** A drop of mercury (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

This incantation creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied square of your choice that you can see. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the incantation ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.  

The disk is immobile while you are within 4 squares of it. If you move more than 4 squares away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 4 squares of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 2 squares or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 2-square deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.  

If you move more than 20 squares from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the incantation ends.  

*Arcana check:* With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you can give the floating disk a simple instruction. It can be further than 20 squares away from you while fulfilling the instruction.  

### Identify  

Level 1 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A pearl (28 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the incantation. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any magical effects are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by an art or power, you learn which art or power created it.  

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what magical effects, if any, are currently affecting it. 

*Arcana check:* With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you have one additional question about the item or creature answered - like its age, provenance or creator.  

### Illusory Script  

Level 1 Illusion Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 minute  
**Components:** A lead-based ink (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 10 days  

You hide a message on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material.  

To you and any creatures familiar with your technique, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown script that is unintelligible. 

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.  

*Arcana check:* With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you can instead can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.  

### Mage’s Mark  

Level 1 Transmutation Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 minute  
**Components:** Fresh candle and silver stylus (14 gp)  
**Duration:** Permanent  

Every mage has their own mark, usually an elaborate and unique rune. This ritual allows a mage to inscribe their mark on any non-magical substance, including stone and metal. The rune remains permanently upon the surface, only disappearing if the item or surface itself is destroyed. The mage may choose to make this mark visible to all, or only to those with the sight (meaning that most folk will not be able to see it at all, but anyone with Arcana training will see it).  

### Understand Languages  

Level 1 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** A pinch of soot and salt and an amethyst (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.  

This incantation doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.  

*Arcana check:* With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, you can also speak any spoken language you have heard during the duration.  

### Unseen Servant  

Level 1 Conjuration Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** A piece of string, a bit of wood and a glass bauble (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

This incantation creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the incantation ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within 6 squares. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the incantation ends.  

Once on each of your turns as a swift action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 3 squares and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.  

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 12 squares away from you, the incantation ends.  

*Arcana check:* With a successful Arcana check (DC 12) at the time of casting, the duration extends to 24 hours and the incantation does not end if the servant moves more than 12 squares away from you.  

### Perpetual Message  

Level 3 Illusion Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A small bit of honeycomb and jade dust (54 gp)  
**Duration:** Permanent  

You implant a message within an object within 6 squares, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the incantation to deliver your message.  

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. After it delivers the message, the *magic mouth* incantation ends.  

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 6 squares of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 6 squares of the object or when a silver bell rings within 6 squares of it.  

*Arcana check:* With a successful Arcana check (DC 14) at the time of casting, you can choose for the incantation to not end after it delivers its message, but instead for it to remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.  

### Sphere of Silence  

Level 3 Illusion Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** A bell cast from gold (27 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 4-square burst centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting incantations is impossible there.  

*Arcana check:* With a successful Arcana check (DC 14) at the time of casting, the target can be an object or creature instead of a point. The burst of silence moves with the object or creature.  

### Continual Flame  

Level 5 Crafting Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Ruby dust (80 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A *continual flame* can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.  

### Dismiss Magic  

Level 5 Practical Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 72 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 minute  
**Components:** A bone from a dead spellcaster (72 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within 24 squares. Any incantation or non-martial power of 5th level or lower on the target ends. For each incantation or non-martial power of 6th level or higher (or no level) on the target, make an Arcana check. The DC equals 10 + the incantation or power’s level. On a successful check, the effect ends.

Alternatively, a magic item you touch becomes non-magical for the next 10 minutes.

*Arcana check:* You can instead choose a magic item within 24 squares to become non-magical for 10 minutes, but you must succeed on an Arcana check vs the wielder’s Will (if it has a wielder).  

### Liquid Tread  

Level 5 Transportation Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** A piece of a famous shipwreck (40 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

This incantation grants one target the ability to move across any liquid surface - such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava - as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). 

If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the incantation carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 12 squares per round.  

*Arcana check:* With a DC 15 Arcana check, you can choose up to 10 targets for this incantation.  

### Meld into Stone  

Level 5 Practical Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Incense (40 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.  

State a trigger. When that trigger is satisfied you are expelled from the stone and the incantation ends. Otherwise, you must wait for the 8 hour duration to end. 

While merged with the stone, you can hear but not see what occurs outside it. You remain aware of the passage of time while merged in the stone. 

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.  

*Arcana check:* If you succeed on a DC 15 Arcana check at the time of casting, while melded in stone you can use your movement to leave the stone whenever you want, instead of waiting for the trigger. You leave the stone from where you entered it, and doing so ends the incantation.  

### Sorcerous Gills  

Level 5 Practical Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** A short reed or piece of straw, and 40 gp  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

This incantation grants a willing creature the ability to breathe underwater until the incantation ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.   

*Arcana check:* With a DC 15 Arcana check, you can choose up to 10 targets for this incantation.  

### Spectral Steed  

Level 5 Crafting Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Incense (40 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the incantation vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 2 squares away from the steed.  

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 20 squares and can travel 10 miles in an hour. When the incantation ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The incantation ends if you use a swift action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage. 

*Arcana check:* With a DC 15 Arcana check, the steed can also walk on water as if the *liquid tread* incantation had been used on it. With higher Arcana check DCs, the steed may have other movement abilities like the ability to phase through objects or to fly (with a maximum altitude, or without a maximum altitude with an even higher DC).  

### Tiny Hut  

Level 5 Crafting Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A small crystal bead (40 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

An immobile dome of force springs into existence in a 2-square burst around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The incantation ends if you leave its area.  

The incantation fails if its edge intersects a creature. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this incantation can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.  

Until the incantation ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.  

*Arcana check:* With a DC 15 Arcana check, the dome’s burst radius is 4 squares instead of 2.  

### Contact Other Plane  

Level 9 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 168 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Incense (168 gp)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this incantation, make a DC 19 Arcana check. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are overawed until you finish a long rest. While overawed, you can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A *restoration* art used on you ends this effect.  

On a successful check, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the incantation ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.  

### Call Forth the Dweller  

Level 11 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Forty-two mystic symbols inscribed around the perimeter of the target doorway (requiring materials costing 360 gp)  
**Duration:** See below  

This incantation contacts the enigmatic, extradimensional being known as the Dweller on the Threshold, an entity that imparts knowledge about its specific obsession: doors and other entrances.  

To cast *call forth the Dweller*, the caster must inscribe forty-two mystic symbols around an open doorway, then begin the chants and supplications required for the incantation.  

If the incantation succeeds, an image of the Dweller—an inky mass of tentacles and mouths—appears on the other side of the doorway. The Dweller on the Threshold truthfully answers any questions it is asked about a particular door. For example, the Dweller can provide a magical password that unlocks a door, indicate how to disarm a trap on a door, reveal the weaknesses of a door’s guardian, or describe the room that lies beyond the door. Its answers are clear and fairly specific, if somewhat terse. The caster may well appreciate such concise answers, because one of the forty-two symbols inscribed around the doorway during the casting of the incantation fades away with each word the Dweller on the Threshold speaks—and when all the symbols are gone, the Dweller disappears.  

If the caster asks the Dweller on the Threshold a question that doesn’t involve doors, the Dweller responds with a cutting insult, often about something the caster thought was secret. Each word of the insult likewise makes a symbol disappear from the perimeter of the doorway.  

The exact nature of the Dweller on the Threshold is shrouded in mystery.  

### Hrothgar’s Journey  

Level 11 Transportation Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A windowless, thatched hut in a forest (360 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

*Hrothgar’s journey* is an incantation based on the tale of Hrothgar, a powerful barbarian hero from ages past. When the poetic epic of Hrothgar is recited in the stifling heat of a sweat lodge during the winter solstice, the orator and his listeners receive the same final reward that Hrothgar did: a one-way trip to Asgard’s Valhalla, where they can drink and make merry with the greatest warriors of myth.  

To cast the incantation, the caster must construct a small, windowless hut in the middle of the forest, then build a bonfire in the hut’s center. At least four and up to twelve others accompany the caster into the hut. Other participants must provide the dialogue for other characters in the epic of Hrothgar. Then the flames are lit and the telling of the tale of Hrothgar begins.  

Because the bonfire is large and the hut is small, the atmosphere inside quickly gets stiflingly hot. Any creature inside the hut must make an Endure check (DC 20) every 10 minutes or suffer the effects of severe heat (lose a recovery).  

Just as the tale of Hrothgar approaches its conclusion (near the end of the casting time), the bonfire’s flames light the hut on fire, which creates a great deal of smoke but no additional heat or damage. The flames consume the hut’s roof and walls, revealing Valhalla. If the caster succeeds on a DC 19 Arcana check, they can choose the exact location in Valhalla that the party appears.

### Summon Item  

Level 11 Conjuration Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A sapphire (720 gp)  
**Duration:** Permanent  

You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The incantation leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this incantation, you must use a different sapphire.  

At any time thereafter, you can use a standard action to speak the item’s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the incantation ends.  

If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.  

*Dismiss magic* or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this incantation’s effect. 

*Arcana check:* With an Arcana check, the object can weigh more than 10 pounds (the number of pounds is the DC of the Arcana check).  

### Telepathic Bond  

Level 11 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures, one rare (360 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice in the area, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren’t affected by this incantation.  

Until the incantation ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can’t extend to other planes of existence.  

*Arcana check:* With a DC 19 Arcana check, the duration is 1 week.  

### Plane Walk  

Level 13 Transportation Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 680 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A forked, metal rod (680 gp), attuned to a particular plane of existence  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, and you appear in or near that destination.   

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this incantation can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.  

*Arcana check:* With a DC 28 Arcana check, you appear in the exact place you specify on the plane.  

### Moving Castle  

Level 21 Practical Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 9,000 gp  
**Completion Time:** 24 hours  
**Components:** Chevron amethyst (18,000 gp)  
**Duration:** Permanent  

Select a dwelling somewhere between a hut and a small castle in size. The dwelling lifts itself off the ground and grows one of the following means of transport:   

* **Levitation:** The dwelling floats over the ground and over water, giving it fly 6 (hover, maximum altitude 2).  
* **Chicken Legs:** The dwelling runs along the ground, giving it speed 12.    
* **Rollers:** The dwelling moves on treads on the ground, giving it speed 8 - but it ignores difficult, obstructing and other terrain.   

The dwelling follows your spoken instructions if they are given from within or just outside the dwelling, about as faithfully as a dim but well-meaning dog might.   

You can instruct the dwelling to ‘settle’. When given this command, the dwelling lowers to the ground beneath it, concealing its means of locomotion, and appears to be a regular building.  

## Athletics  

### Weight Distribution  

Level 2 Trick Practice (Athletics)  

**Cost to Learn:** 21 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 minute  
**Components:** 1 recovery  
**Duration:** One day  

Count your load as if it were one step lighter than it actually is (light load instead of a medium load, etc).  

## Bluff  

### Teach Cant  

Level 1 Lesson Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 28 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** 28 gp  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The subject of a *teach cant* lesson learns the cant used by thieves, urchins and demi-mondaines. A character who learns this art learns cant along with it, if they did not already know it.  

### Backup Disguise  

Level 2 Trick Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 21 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** 21 gp  
**Duration:** Until your next long rest  

You prepare a specific disguise that you keep at the ready, worn underneath your outer garment. You can change into this disguise as a standard action. Having a backup disguise doesn’t allow you to remove your armor or any other complex piece of clothing any more quickly, but once you have those off, the disguise is readily available. Because you have the backup disguise at the ready, it’s possible that a thorough search might reveal some elements of the disguise.  

### Use Magic Device  

Level 2 Trick Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 21 gp  
**Completion Time:** See below  
**Components:** 1 recovery  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You use a magic item or other magical device even if you do not meet the prerequisites to do so. You must succeed on a Bluff check (easy DC based on the level of the magic item or device) in order to do so. If you fail, there may be negative consequences depending on the item or device. The completion time is double the normal time it takes to activate the item.  

### Hidden Magic  

Level 6 Trick Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 72 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Alchemical reagents (72 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 year  

You carefully tweak a magic item to appear non-magical according to incantations, powers and skills that observe magical auras.  

### Social Identity  

Level 6 Trick Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 72 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** Bribes, materials, etc. (144 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You create a social identity, with its own name, alignment, and abilities. This identity is not a false front; you really are your social identity as well as your original identity, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other. 

Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don’t reduce the time required to change identities.

Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity’s alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as an artifact that only respects good characters) only if both of your identities qualify. Researching one of your identities don’t reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the research knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn’t exist.  

### Nameless One  

Level 15 Trick Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 1,000 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** Bribes, disguises or the like (1,000 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You eschew all of your former identities, going as far as to render your former name completely inaccessible to discover by mortal means. After this practice, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you. You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. 

At the art’s conclusion, you must don the mask created for the art, the appearance of which is evocative of your title. While you’re wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist.  

## Diplomacy  

### Teach Signs  

Level 1 Lesson Practice (Diplomacy)  

**Cost to Learn:** 28 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** 28 gp  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The subject of a *teach signs* lesson learns a basic sign language. A character who learns this art learns a basic sign language along with it, if they did not already know it.  

### Dealmaker  

Level 5 Interaction Practice (Diplomacy)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 1 recovery  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You have the air of a person with money, allowing you to buy and sell valuables that otherwise are too rich for the local community. When looking to buy or sell an item that would normally be outside that available for sale or purchase in the local community, make a Diplomacy check (DC depends on the level of the item and the size of the community). On a success, you’re able to sell or purchase that item.  

### Entourage

**Components:** Gifts, treats and rewards (208 gp)

Your admirers are helpful to you, allowing you to make simple requests of them such as purchasing basic equipment with your funds or finding a room at an inn.

You can still fall asleep, either by choice or because you are affected by something that makes you sleep. You can end this craft at any time. Until you do so, you cannot regain the recovery you spent on this craft.

## Heal  

### Embalm Corpse  

Level 1 Treatment Practice (Heal)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Embalming fluids (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 10 days  

You treat a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.

The craft also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this incantation don’t count against the time limit of crafts and incantations such as *raise dead*.

A corpse can be embalmed more than once. The duration is not cumulative: the benefit ends 10 days after the most recent embalming.

*Heal check:* With a successful DC 12 Heal check, the duration is 100 days.

**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Lapis lazuli (27 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Duration:** Instantaneous  

In even a brief conversation or social interaction, you pick up on subtle social and visual cues to learn a great deal about a person’s origin and history. You might notice bits of green under the person’s fingernails and determine they’re an herbalist, a pin indicating their membership in a secret society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city district where a vampire lives, but wouldn’t learn any of their weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire.

Spend 1 minute, then attempt an Insight check. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check if you engaged the person in conversation during this time. If the person is deliberately trying to conceal their nature or present a false identity, you learn about their false biography rather than their true one unless the result of your Insight check exceeds their Bluff check. 

*Insight check:* On a DC 10 Insight check, you learn the creature’s profession and the region of the world they hail from, but no more.  
If you beat the DC by 10 or more, you learn the creature’s profession and specialty within that profession. You learn the nation or settlement where they normally live.  
If you beat the DC by 20 or more, you learn the creature’s profession, their specialty within that profession, and a major accomplishment or controversy from their career. You also learn the nation and settlement where they live, as well as the district in a city large enough to have districts. In addition, you learn the nation or settlement where they spent their formative years.

On a failure, you come to a false conclusion about the creature’s profession and the region of the world they hail from.

### Teach Trick  

Level 1 Lesson Practice (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** See below  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Animals and other unintelligent creatures can be taught a trick using this method. The component cost equals the cost of a consumable item of the creature’s level. An animal can be taught multiple tricks over the week, but multiply the component cost by the number of tricks taught. 

* Attack: The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able.
* Come: The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.
* Defend: The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.
* Down: The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.
* Fetch: The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.
* Guard: The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.

* Track: The animal tracks the scent presented to it. 
* Work: The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.  

### Spirit Speaker  

Level 2 Divination Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 21 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Incense (21 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

When an animal dies, its spirit lingers briefly before moving on. Using low chants, body language that shows respect, and special movements that demonstrate to the spirit that you are an ally, you glean information from the spirit of an animal that has been dead no longer than 1 day.   

Attempt a Nature check at a DC determined by the GM (normally, this is the appropriate DC for the level of the animal or beast when it was alive). Regardless of the result of your check, the spirit immediately departs and can’t be used for *spirit speaker* again. 

If you succeed, the spirit answers you truthfully. The spirit’s answer is likely to be terse or cryptic compared to normal communication with an animal, and it can pertain only to things the creature directly experienced or considered important. The spirit doesn’t remember anything that happened more than 1 day ago.

If you fail, the spirit doesn’t answer you. If you fail by 10 or more, the spirit is wracked with misery or bewilderment and gives you an erroneous answer.  

### Animal Message  

Level 3 Conjuration Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A morsel of food and a fossil (27 gp)  
**Duration:** Special  

By means of this incantation, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired gnome wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words.  

The target beast travels for the duration of the incantation toward the specified location, covering about 2 miles per hour for a flying messenger, or 1 mile per hour for other animals.   

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the incantation ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this incantation.  

*Nature check:* The duration of the incantation is your Nature check result in hours.  

### Locate Animals or Plants  

Level 3 Scrying Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** A bit of fur from a bloodhound and a silver dowsing rod (27 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant. Concentrating on the voice of nature in your surroundings, you learn the direction and distance to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles, if any are present.  

*Nature check:* With a DC 14 Nature check, you learn a further detail about the beast or plant you described, or the range extends to 10 miles.  

### Bonded Companion  

Level 5 Practical Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 8 hours  
**Components:** An item with special significance to both participants (of any monetary value)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You perform this incantation over two participants: the master and the bonded companion. You may include yourself in the incantation as the master, if desired. The item with special significance is placed between them, and at the completion of the incantation it turns to smoke.   

The bonded companion follows the Companion rules, as well as the following special rules: 

* If the master takes a move action, the companion can take a move action as well.  
* If the master is incapacitated or not present, the companion gets its full complement of actions without needing to be “commanded”.    
* The companion’s level is equal to the master’s, unless it was already higher.  
* The companion’s maximum HP are equal to the master’s staggered value, unless it was already higher.   
* The companion uses the master’s defenses, except where the companion’s defense is higher.
* The companion has no recoveries of its own, but can use its master’s.   
* Either participant in the incantation can end its effects as a swift action.  

### Speak with Plants  

Level 5 Divination Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** The heart or core of a plant over 100 years old (40 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You imbue plants within 6 squares of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events within 6 squares within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.  

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.  

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The incantation doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.  

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.  

### Express Rider  

Level 6 Interaction Practice (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 72 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 minute  
**Components:** 1 recovery  
**Duration:** One day  

You know how to encourage your mount to cover ground quickly. When calculating your travel speed for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature check increase your mount’s travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based on the mount’s level or the difficulty of the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your mount’s travel speed by half. This has no effect on your mount’s movement in encounters.  

### Consult Nature  

Level 9 Divination Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 168 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** An emerald (168 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the incantation gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 60 squares. The incantation doesn’t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.  

You instantly gain knowledge of one fact of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:  

- terrain and bodies of water  
- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples  
- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead  
- influence from other planes of existence  
- buildings  

For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.  

*Nature check:* With a DC 18 Nature check, you gain knowledge of three facts of your choice, or one fact from outside the subject areas specified.

### Alchemy  

Level 1 Schema Practice (None)  

**Cost to Learn:** See below  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** See below  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Rather than a single practice, alchemy is a category of practices. Each potion and alchemical item has its own practice (*alchemy: potion of healing, alchemy: salve of resurrection,* and so on), which a character can learn after studying another of the same variety for 1 hour, or from scratch with 8 hours. The cost to learn equals the cost of a consumable item of the level of the potion or alchemical item.  

The component cost to make one of those items equals the cost to buy the item.  

You cannot learn the practice of an item of a level higher than your own.

Level 1 Schema Practice (None)  

**Cost to Learn:** See below  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** See below

Rather than a single practice, poisoncraft is a category of practices. Each poison has its own practice (*poisoncraft: pale tincture, poisoncraft: repulsion resin,* and so on), which a character can learn after studying another of the same variety for 1 hour, or from scratch with 8 hours. The cost to learn equals the cost of a consumable item of the level of the poison.  

The component cost to make one of those items equals the cost to buy the item.

### Cobble Together

**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** See below  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Rather than a single practice, enchant item is a category of practices. Each enchanted item boost has its own practice (*enchant item: dragonbane weapon, enchant item: dismissal focus,* and so on), which a character can learn after studying another of the same variety for 1 hour, or from scratch with 8 hours. The cost to learn equals the cost of a consumable item of the level of a +1 item with that boost.  

The component cost to make one of those magic items equal the cost to buy the item. If an existing enchanted item is consumed during the crafting process, deduct its cost from the component cost.  

You cannot learn the practice of an item of a level higher than your own.  

### Craft Wondrous Items  

Level 2 Schema Practice (None)  

**Cost to Learn:** See below  
**Completion Time:** 1 week

**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Rather than a single practice, craft wondrous item is a category of practices. Each wondrous item has its own practice (*craft wondrous item: bag of ogres, craft wondrous item: decanter of endless water,* and so on), which a character can learn after studying another of the same variety for 1 hour, or from scratch with 8 hours. The cost to learn equals the cost of a consumable item of the level of a +1 item with that boost.

### Brilliant Planner  

Level 5 Schema Practice (None)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 8 hours  
**Components:** See below  
**Duration:** See below  

You can prepare for future contingencies without defining what those preparations are until they are relevant. This practice requires you to be in a settlement. Spend up to 50 gp per character level, which becomes your brilliant plan fund. While you have a brilliant plan pending, you are always treated as carrying 20 additional pounds of weight, even before you define your brilliant plan.

Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to enact a brilliant plan, withdrawing an item that would have been available in a settlement you visited or procuring a mundane service that your character planned ahead of time. Once you enact the plan, subtract the price of the item or service from the fund. Any item procured must weigh 10 pounds or less. Likewise, the GM must approve any non-magical service you gain by using your fund as being appropriate for the location selected.

Once you have spent all the money in your brilliant plan fund or procured 20 pounds of objects, you must use the practice again to replenish your brilliant plan fund.  

## Religion  

### Detect Otherworldly  

Level 1 Divination Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Incense (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

For the duration, you know if there is a creature of the cosmic, elemental, fey, outsider or shadow source or with the celestial, demon, devil or undead tags within 6 squares of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 6 squares of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The incantation can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.  

### Witness an Oath  

Level 1 Practical Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 1 recovery  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You swear an oath or bear witness to one sworn by another. 

To swear an oath, the subject names—very specifically—a task they will accomplish in no more than one year’s time. If the task is not completed in that time, or if conditions arise that indicate the failure of the oath, they lose all recoveries, and cannot regain them for a month. 

The oath-swearer cannot be tricked into thinking an oath is fulfilled when it is not, and no magical compulsion can force them to stop attempting to fulfill it. 

Oaths can be singular tasks (destroy the Dark Tower) or ongoing (keep King Dari alive). Ongoing oaths can be renewed at the end of each year. An oath must be something measurable, so the character knows whether it has been fulfilled. 

One day after the oath is fulfilled or one month after it is broken, you regain the recovery you spent on this craft.

The oath-swearer receive a +2 power bonus on skill checks while working towards their oath, and a +2 power bonus to defenses against attacks that would directly stop them from working towards their oath.  

### Augury  

Level 3 Divination Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Incense (27 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:  

- *Weal*, for good results  
- *Woe*, for bad results  
- *Weal and woe*, for both good and bad results  
- *Nothing*, for results that aren’t especially good or bad  

The incantation doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome.  

If you cast the incantation two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.  

### Remove Curse  

Level 5 Curative Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Incense (80 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

At your touch, all curses of your level or lower (or no level) affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the incantation breaks its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.  

*Religion check:* With a successful Religion check (moderate DC based on the curse’s level), you can remove curses of a level higher than your own.  

### Speak with the Departed  

Level 5 Divination Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Incense (40 gp)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The incantation fails if the corpse was the target of this incantation within the last 10 days.  

Until the incantation ends, you can ask the corpse a question. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This incantation doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.  

*Religion check:* With a DC 15 Religion check, you can ask up to five questions.  

### Commune  

Level 9 Divination Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 168 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Incense and a vial of holy or unholy water (168 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You contact a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the incantation ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.  

Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge.

*Religion check:* With a DC 18 Religion check, you contact a more powerful entity aligned strongly with your interests, possibly even your deity. The entity won’t attempt to deceive you, though it still might not know the answers. When it’s important to provide clarity, the entity will answer your questions with up to five words, such as “If you leave immediately” or “That was true once.”  

### Prescient Divination  

Level 9 Divination Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 168 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion (168 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.  

The incantation doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome.  

*Religion check:* With a DC 18 Religion check, the answer is less cryptic than it otherwise would have been.  

### Forbid Intrusion  

Level 11 Abjuration Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby (360 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 day  

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 1,600 squares of floor space to a height of 6 squares above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals to enter the area. The incantation proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Plane of Faerie, Plane of Shadow, or the *plane walk* incantation.  

In addition, the incantation damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following tags: air, celestial, cold, demon, devil, earth, fire, water or undead. When a creature with that tag enters the incantation’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this incantation).  

When you cast this incantation, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the incantation.  

The incantation’s area can’t overlap with the area of another *forbid intrusion* incantation. If you cast *forbid intrusion* every day for 7 days in the same location, the incantation lasts until it is dispelled.  

### Geas  

Level 11 Practical Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 1 recovery (until effect ends)  
**Duration:** One day / level or until discharged  

A *geas* places a command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must be of your level or lower and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

If the instructions are to complete a specific, achievable goal, the geased creature must follow the given instructions until the *geas* is completed, no matter how long it takes.  

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through their own actions the craft remains in effect for a maximum of one day per level you have. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the *geas* for 24 hours, it loses one recovery. It cannot regain this recovery while the geas remains.

*Religion check:* With a moderate DC Religion check (based on the level of the target), you can target a creature of level higher than your own.  

### Restore Revenant  

Level 11 Curative Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 8 hours  
**Components:** Incense (360 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

The target of the incantation is brought back to life, with the Revenant bond. Make a Religion check. The result determines what starting Favor the target begins with. *Religion result 10 or less:* -3 Favor. *Religion result 11-15:* 0 Favor. *Religion result 16-20:* 5 Favor. *Religion result 21-25:* 10 Favor. *Religion result 26 or more:* 15 Favor.  

### Fires of the Abyss  

Level 21 Conjuration Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 2 hours  
**Components:** Rare unguents and dark alchemical concoctions (360 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

This incantation, dreamed up by cultists, opens a fell rift between the current location and a fiery layer of the Abyss. This rift brings about a massive conflagration that destroys almost everything in the immediate area, then releases a powerful demon who capers over the smoldering ruins and begins to rampage across the countryside. The *fires of the Abyss* ignite everything they touch—except for the caster, who is knocked unconscious and transported to a layer of the Abyss.  

When the incantation is complete, the *fires of the Abyss* erupt from the caster’s former location.

*Attack:* Near burst 16; +26 vs Reflex; on a hit, the target takes 18d6 fire damage. On a miss, the target takes half damage. Either way, everything flammable in the burst is lit on fire.  

*Secondary Effect:* At initiative count 20 on the following round, a balor comes through the rift, which then closes. The balor begins to destroy everything in sight.  

## Sleight of Hand  

### Craft Trap  

Level 1 Schema Practice (Sleight of Hand)  

**Cost to Learn:** See below  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** See below  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Rather than a single practice, craft trap is a category of practices. Each trap has its own practice (*craft trap: snare trap, craft trap: scythe trap,* and so on), which a character can learn after studying another of the same variety for 1 hour, or from scratch with 8 hours. The cost to learn equals the cost of a consumable item of the trap's level.  

The component cost to make one of those traps depends on the type of trap: start with the cost of a consumable item of the trap's level and halve it for a one-off trap and double it for a recurring trap. Hazards use the cost of a consumable item of the trap’s level.  

You cannot learn the practice of a trap of a level higher than your own.  

## Stealth  

### Foil Senses  

Level 1 Trick Practice (Stealth)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Special materials suitable for thwarting the specified special sense (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You make it impossible for a creature that is tracking you or searching for you to use one of its special senses, like scent or tremorsense, to assist it in doing so.  

## Streetsmarts  

### Carouse  

Level 1 Interaction Practice (Streetsmarts)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14 gp  
**Completion Time:** 4 hours  
**Components:** Shouted drinks (14 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You cope through drink and revelry, and have mastered both. You can gain the benefits of a long rest by spending 4 hours drinking, carousing, and taking the occasional blackout nap. You can carouse in this way so long as you consume at least 4 pints’ worth of ale (or equivalent drink), and you are alert and aware of your surroundings while doing so. 

If you carouse with another creature in this way, you can attempt to learn secrets from it by drinking it under the table. Each hour you spend carousing with a willing creature, make an Endure check vs the target’s Fortitude. On a success, that creature answers a question truthfully (even questions it would not normally answer).  

### Shady Connections  

Level 2 Interaction Practice (Streetsmarts)  

**Cost to Learn:** 21 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Bribes or gifts (21 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You have dealings with a variety of unsavory characters, which you can leverage to trade favors or meet powerful people. When you’re in an area where you have connections (typically a settlement where you’ve spent downtime building connections or possibly another area in the same nation), you can arrange a meeting with an important criminal, such as a thieves’ guild leader, or ask for a favor in exchange for a later favor of your contact’s choice.  

### Sow Rumor  

Level 2 Interaction Practice (Streetsmarts)  

**Cost to Learn:** 21 gp  
**Completion Time:** 2 hours  
**Components:** Shouted drinks, bribed journalists or the like (42 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You spread rumors, which may or may not be true, about a specific subject. If the subject of your rumor is not currently the subject of any contradictory rumors, this typically takes 2 hours, at the end of which you make a Streetsmarts check to see how well you spread the rumor. If your rumor matches any current rumors about the subject, it takes less time to spread the rumor, and if you are attempting to overtake a particularly popular and contradictory rumor, it takes much longer or may be impossible. The DC similarly increases or decreases depending on how plausible your rumor is. If you succeed, you successfully spread the rumor. If you fail, your rumor dies off. If you fail by 10 or more, a rumor spreads about someone trying to spread false rumors about the subject.  

### Party Crasher  

Level 7 Interaction Practice (Streetsmarts)  

**Cost to Learn:** 104 gp  
**Completion Time:** 2 hours  
**Components:** Bribes, disguises or distractions (104 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Any time you encounter a social event you would ordinarily be denied access to, such as a coronation, royal gala, or other society function, you can secure entry without the need for a skill check. You find invitations, invitees looking for fashionable dates, temporary jobs with the caterers, event staff willing to look the other way, or some other mode of access for yourself and your allies. This ability doesn’t apply to secret events or other small private gatherings with no staff, dates, or outsiders involved.  

### Safe House  

Level 11 Trick Practice (Streetsmarts)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360 gp  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** Bribes, development applications and construction costs (720 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You establish a safe house—a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It’s in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands by one 10-foot cube each time you use this craft.     

# Extended Challenges  

### Babysitting

**Setup:** The PCs are watching the three children of two affluent nobles while they attend an annual gala. By ensuring the safety of the children, the PCs hope to earn a favor from the nobles.

**Level:** 1.

**Check Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes. If one hour passes without the requisite successes, the extended challenge fails as the nobles return from the gala. 

**Primary Skills:** Acrobatics (moderate, DC 12), Diplomacy (hard, DC 18), Insight (difficult, DC 18), Intimidate (moderate, DC 12), Perception (difficult, DC 18), Sleight of Hand (moderate, DC 12).

**Failure:** The nobles require a fee to perform the favor. A particularly poor effort at looking after the kids may anger the nobles, leading them to refuse to help point blank, or even create a lasting enmity. 

**Backlash:** PCs that fail a check by 10 points or more lead to the children acting up. Choose one, or make up one based on how the PCs have been amusing the children: 

* *Escapees:* The children escape. The children must be recovered before any further checks are made; a Streetsmarts check (moderate, DC 12) is one way to recover them. 
* *Blackmail:* The children start playing piggy in the middle with a vase, on the marble floor of the foyer. If the PCs handle things poorly, the vase falls and breaks in two. This counts as one failure unless the PCs patch things up (literally or figuratively). 

### Missing Sage

**Setup:** The PCs must research the personal study of a missing town sage to search for clues regarding his disappearance.

**Level:** 2.

**Check Successes Required:** 5 before 3 failures. 

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check each day. If five days pass without the requisite successes, the extended challenge fails. 

**Primary Skills:** History (moderate, DC 13), Insight (hard, DC 19), Nature (moderate, DC 13), Perception (hard, DC 19), Streetsmarts (moderate, DC 13).

**Success:** The leader of the bandits in the woods outside town claims to be the deposed lord of the neighboring barony, and wants to raise an army to take back his title and lands. The sage’s notes indicate that he was planning on seeking out this bandit lord and using his records to prove the veracity of the claim.

**Failure:** The sage suffers a gruesome fate at the hands of the bandit leader—if he isn’t dead, he’s certainly unable to offer them much assistance for a time, if ever.

**Backlash:** PCs that fail on relevant checks learn one of the following pieces of gossip, which may or may not be true:

* At low tide, a hidden entrance to underground caverns becomes visible beneath the town’s docks. According to a number of local legends, pirates hid their booty in the caves. 
* The flower seller in the town square is the local priest’s illegitimate daughter. Given the priest’s vow of chastity, if this knowledge became public, he could lose respect among the townsfolk and likely his position as the town’s priest.

PCs that succeed on their checks may also learn the gossip, but they realize it is not germane to the current challenge. 

### Powering the Runestone

**Setup:** The PCs must reactivate a failed runestone in order to dismiss an eldritch horror attacking the village (like a blood-drinker hag, shadow drake or umbral mass).

**Level:** 3.

**Check Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures. 

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check as a standard action. If one minute passes without the requisite successes, the extended challenge fails. 

**Primary Skills:** Arcana (easy, DC 9)

**Success:** The PCs reactivate the runestone, dismissing the eldritch horror.  

**Failure:** If the PCs fail to reactivate the runestone, a blast of destructive energies wreck the PCs and the eldritch horror remains in the world. 

*Attack:* Near burst 5, +8 vs Reflex; 2d8+3 points of damage. 

**Backlash:** Failing a skill check by 5 or more causes the runestone to lash out with eldritch power, dealing 1d8+1 points of force damage to the person who failed the check. 

*Secondary Attack:* +8 vs Will; the target is stunned until the end of their next turn.  

### Crossing the Bridge

**Setup:** The PCs must make their way across the chasm’s bridge without damaging the bridge’s integrity or risk falling.

**Level:** 4.

**Successes Required:** Each character must cross before a total of 3 failures. 

**Distance:** The bridge is 100 feet long (20 squares) and 5 feet wide (1 square).  

**Primary Skills:** Acrobatics (easy, DC 10) after each move action

Characters move as normal across the bridge, but if they fail the Acrobatics check then the bridge becomes difficult terrain until the end of their next turn as it shakes and twists. 

If the bridge is already difficult terrain and a character fails their Acrobatics check, all characters on the bridge suffer an attack: +9 vs Reflex; on a hit, the target falls prone. 

**Success:** The PCs cross the bridge. 

**Failure:** The bridge breaks in the middle. All characters on the bridge suffer an attack: +9 vs Reflex; on a hit, the target falls 40 feet to the base of the chasm. On a miss, the target grabs hold of the bridge and can climb up (Athletics, DC 10). 

Characters that fall into the chasm must use Athletics (DC 10) to climb up the stretch of bridge to one side of the chasm or the other. 

**Extra:** A character in the 2-square stretch in the middle of the bridge can make a Sleight of Hand check (DC 14) to increase the number of failures before the extended challenge is a failure to 4. A failure on this check counts towards total failures, however.  

**Special:** This is a good challenge to pair with a battle, perhaps with ranged attackers on the other side of the bridge. 

### Escape the Guard

**Setup:** The PCs have been accused of treason, and must flee the city before they are apprehended by the king’s guard.

**Level:** 5.

**Frequency:** Round-by-round. 

**Opposition:** There are two groups of five guards each – one from the South Tower and one from the West Tower. Use the stats for four gang members (“guard members”) and one gang leader (“guard leader”). The guards have speed 6 (for a total of 16 when using both actions to dash). 

The South Tower guards act on initiative 10, from round 1. 

The West Tower guards act on initiative 15, from round 6. 

**The Distance:** 

*Yonder Street (120 feet):* A long, narrow street (10 feet wide before the stalls on both sides, which are about 5 feet deep). Leads into the Twisting Bazaar. 

*The Twisting Bazaar:* The PCs wander into a bazaar whose colorful tents create a dizzying maze roughly 100 square feet in size. Only one character in the group needs to make a Streetsmarts check (moderate, DC 15) to escape to Fish Street. However, if the party is split up (they entered the bazaar on different rounds and didn't wait for one another) then each group must pass the check separately. 

*Fish Street (120 feet):* A long, narrow street (10 feet wide). Leads to freedom. 

**Interventions:**

*"Stop them!" (swift, once per street):* The guards are on one of the streets; the guards call for the immediate arrest of the PCs, and the PCs' frantic demeanor makes the city’s inhabitants suspicious of their actions and intentions. Each PC must make a Bluff check (easy, DC 10; moderate if the PC dashed last turn, DC 15) at the start of their turn or the entire street is difficult terrain for that turn. 

*"You've got the wrong guy!" (standard, once per street):* *Stop them!* is in effect for the street; Bluff (moderate, DC 15) or Intimidate (hard, DC 22). On a success, the crowd blames someone else. PCs ignore *Stop them!* for this street.

*"We're the people's heroes!" (standard, once per street):* Diplomacy (moderate, DC 15) or Bluff (hard, DC 22). On a success, the guards are subject to *Stop them!* for this street; the PCs are not. 

*"There you are!" (standard, at-will):* If the party is split into multiple groups in the bazaar: Streetsmarts (easy, DC 10). On a success, two groups in the bazaar find one another. 

*Climb the roofs (standard, at-will):* Athletics (moderate, DC 15). On a success, the character is on the roofs of the houses. It is the same distance to the end of the street, but not affected by *Stop them!* or other obstacles. Guards may climb onto the roofs to intercept the PCs depending on what is happening on the street. This only works on the two streets: the bazaar's roof is made up of soft fabric that will not bear weight. 

*"We'll cut our way through" (standard, at-will):* The fabric sides of the tents of the bazaar have AC 10 and 20 HP. Flip a coin each time a tent is cut through – on a heads, it is an outer tent and the PCs can escape to Fish Street. However, doing so alienates the residents of the Bazaar, and the DC of any further Streetsmarts checks in the bazaar increases by 5 once PCs start attacking the tents. 

*Hide or disguise (standard, at-will):* Group check, Bluff (easy, DC 10) or Stealth (moderate, DC 15). On a success, the guards lose the PCs. Three stay in the current location to search for them, the guard leader and one guard member head to the next location. 

*Into the sewers (standard, at-will):* Dungeoneering (hard, DC 22). On a success, the PCs enter the sewers. They escape the guards, but for all they know something worse lurks beneath the city ... 

**Thresholds:** At the start of the sixth round, the West Tower guards arrive in Fish Street and set up a blockade 60 feet into Fish Street. 

**Success:** The PCs manage to slip away from the king’s guards.

**Failure:** The PCs fail to escape the king’s guards. They must the guards or surrender, in which case they are brought back to the castle and tossed into the dungeon to await their fate.

### Race to the Tomb

**Setup:** The PCs must race a rival gang of treasure hunters to an ancient tomb so they can claim its treasures for themselves.

**Level:** 5.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every six hours.  

**Opposition:** A rival group of adventurers: one repeater crossbowman, one cowled assassin, one hulk and one shadowblast warlock. 

They act on initiative 15, and take two increments to complete each leg of the distance. 

**The Distance:** The PCs must decide whether to set out at night, or take six hours for a long rest and set out at sunrise. 

*The Winding Road (30 miles):* A dirt road through the canyons. The PCs can complete it in two increments by pushing on (Endure DC 20), or comfortably in three increments (including a long rest in between).  

*Mountainside:* The PCs must scale the side of a large mountain in order to reach the hidden tomb. Each character must succeed on one of the following checks to progress: Athletics (easy, DC 10), Nature (moderate, DC 15), Endure (moderate, DC 15), Acrobatics (moderate, DC 15). PCs that have succeeded can stay at the top to help others with the Aid Another action during the next increment. 

*Entrance:* The PCs have reached the entrance to the tomb. It is trapped with a phase spider venom needle trap. 

**Interventions:**

*Block the way (6 hours, once per stretch):* Athletics (moderate, DC 15). The rival group will take one additional increment to complete this leg, if they have not already completed it.   

**Thresholds:** 

After the 18th hour (after three six-hour increments have passed), a massive thunderstorm rolls into the valley where the tomb is hidden. All skill checks become hard (DC 22) for the next six hours (the fourth increment). 

**Success:** The PCs reach the tomb first, giving them at least six hours to explore and potentially make a get-away before their rivals appear (depending on how far behind they are).

**Failure:** The PCs reach the tomb second, giving their rivals at least six hours to explore and potentially make a get-away before the PCs appear (depending on how far behind they are).

### Cracking the Spellbook

**Setup:** The PCs must search the library of a vanished wizard in order to learn of any wards that the spellcaster might have placed upon his spellbook before he disappeared.  PCs can glean arcane knowledge from the book and catch a rare glimpse at the vanished wizard’s musings and experiments.

**Level:** 6.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check each hour.  

**Successes Required:** 4 before 3 failures. 

**Primary Skills:** Arcana (easy, DC 11), History (moderate, DC 16), Religion (moderate, DC 16)

PCs that track down the wizard's associates with Streetsmarts (easy, DC 11) could also use Diplomacy (moderate, DC 16). 

**Progress:** For each success, the players learn a piece of information: 

* The wizard’s spellbook is warded with a unique symbol spell of his own design. He wanted anyone brazen enough to try and learn from his works to suffer greatly for their arrogance.
* After several failed experiences left his book singed and his library badly burned, the wizard decided a more subtle approach was in order. He began devising a way to make sure that anyone who read from his book without his permission would be unable to read anything ever again.

* The wizard devised a nefarious spell gylph that, when activated, puts all affected to sleep. Those who fell asleep from the glyph’s influence also permanently lost the ability to read and write. Characters can now alternatively use Sleight of Hand (moderate, DC 16) to deactivate the symbol but if they fail it triggers.

* The wizard designed a bypass mechanic for his spellbook’s trap so he wouldn’t need to be bothered with constantly disarming and rearming the trap. The glyph does not trigger for anyone who opens the spellbook while wearing a signet ring with the wizard’s insignia upon it.

**Success:** The PCs know that they can reliably bypass the spellbook’s wards and defenses with the signet ring, which they may have already or know where to find, or they can try their luck with a Sleight of Hand check. 

**Failure:** Each time a creature opens the book, unless they are wearing the signet ring, make the following attack: Near burst 12, all creatures; +11 vs Will; the target falls asleep (save ends). *Aftereffect:* The target is cursed to be unable to read or write (until the curse is broken). 

### An Audience with the King

**Setup:** The PCs must convince the king’s majordomo to admit them to the throne room.

**Level:** 7.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check each minute.  

**Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures. 

**Primary Skills:** Bluff (moderate, DC 16), Diplomacy (easy, DC 11), History (moderate, DC 16), Insight (hard, DC 23). 

One time, when a character fails a check, any character can attempt an Intimidate check (moderate, DC 16). On a success, the failed check does not increase the number of failures by one (the Intimidate check does not count as a success itself, however). On a failure, future Diplomacy checks are hard (DC 23). 

**Success:** The majordomo permits the PCs an audience with the king immediately.

**Failure:** The PCs do not receive an audience. 

<figure><img src="pics\LuigiCastellani_SEATEDNOBLE.png" alt="Seated Noble by Luigi Castellani" style="zoom: 33%;" /><figcaption>Seated Noble by Luigi Castellani</figcaption></figure>

### Staying the Course

**Setup:** The PCs must fight to keep their ship on-course during a deadly storm.

**Setting:** At the start of the extended challenge, the PCs can choose which of five locations they are at: the main mast, the quarterdeck, the bowsprit, the crow's nest and the main deck.

**Level:** 8.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check each minute. As well as their check, a PC can move from any other location to the main deck, or from the main deck to any other location (but not both).  

**Successes Required:** 3 (special) before 3 failures. 

One success at each of three locations: the main mast, the quarterdeck and the bowsprit. 

**Primary Skills:** Acrobatics (moderate, DC 17), Athletics (moderate, DC 17). 

**Success:** The PCs weather the storm and can continue sailing without impediment.

**Failure:** The PCs survive the storm, but their ship is battered.

**Side Check:** On their turn, a character in the crow's nest can make a Nature check (moderate, DC 17) to help navigate into calmer waters. This lowers the DC of Acrobatics and Athletics checks to easy (DC 12). 

**Thresholds:**

*At the start of the first minute,* wind speeds increase to moderate (20 mph) and it begins to rain. 

*At the start of the second minute,* the wind speeds increase to strong (30 mph and the rain picks up into a full thunderstorm. At the start of each of their turns, characters suffer an attack: +13 vs Reflex; the target falls prone. If the target is already prone, they are swept overboard and take 4d6 damage. 

Standing up from prone takes a minute, and a successful Acrobatics or Athletics check (DC 12).

A character that is overboard takes 4d6 damage at the end of each turn that they remain overboard.  

Climbing back from overboard takes a minute, and a successful Acrobatics or Athletics check (DC 17). A character on the main deck can forfeit their check to instead throw a rope overboard, which gives the character a +5 bonus on their check. A character who climbs back from overboard arrives at the main deck. 

*At the start of the third minute,* lightning crashes in the sky above the PCs’ vessel. Each minute, there is a 25% chance that a lightning bolt will strike the ship and do 10d6 electricity damage to it (this counts as one additional failure). 

### Living Maze

**Setup:** The PCs must navigate through a living maze that seeks to entrap them within its confines.

**Level:** 8.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes.  

**Successes Required:** Challenge crawl, 4 challenges: 

*Living maze:* The maze that the PCs are traversing is alive, and must be outwitted at every turn. After one character succeeds on a Nature check (moderate, DC 17) or Perception check (hard, DC 24), move on to the next challenge. 

*Hole in reality:* The maze rips an interdimensional hole in itself to whisk the PCs back to the beginning of the maze. If the PCs fail a group Arcana check (moderate, DC 17), then make an attack against all characters: +13 vs Will; the target is teleported back to the beginning of the maze. 

This only occurs once, even if some characters are teleported back to the start. 

*The guardians:* The maze creates stone guardians to attempt to stop the PCs from advancing any further. Four sand sentries, but without the burrow movement. The sand sentries attack to knock the PCs unconscious, and once they do so each sand sentry prioritizes dragging one unconscious PC back to the start of the maze over fighting other PCs who are still conscious (but if attacked while dragging, will turn their attention to the attacker). 

*Stonewalled:* The maze seals its exit with a massive stone wall. Each character must succeed on an Athletics check (easy, DC 12) to climb the wall. Characters that have already passed can help those left behind with a hand or by throwing down a rope (Aid Another). The wall has resistance 20 to all damage and 100 hit points. 

### Would-Be Wedding

**Setup:** After Kyr’shin narrowly bested Gea, a would-be suitor, in single combat, both their kingdoms are hosting lavish celebrations in anticipation of Kyr’shin and Gea’s
betrothal. At the end of the party, the two are expected to announce whether or not they will be married, and the conditions of the marriage. The union of Kyr'shin and Gea's kingdoms would unite the kingdoms against the greater threat from the north.  

**Level:** 10.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes.  

**Protagonists:** 

*Kyr'shin* 

*Setup:* Kyr'shin must be convinced to marry Gea. 

*Successes Required:* 3 successes before 3 failures. 

*Primary Skills:* Athletics (moderate, DC 19), Bluff (moderate, DC 19), Diplomacy (hard, DC 26), History (moderate, DC 19)

Kyr'shin is stand-offish, but with an Insight check (DC 13) the PCs realize he is – despite being a brave warrior – extremely shy in social situations. This insight lowers the Diplomacy DC to easy (DC 13). The Insight success does not count towards total successes. 

*Success:* Kyr'shin agrees to marry Gea. 

*Failure:* Kyr'shin refuses to marry Gea. 



*Inquisitor Sala’dean* 

*Setup:* The Inquisitor is trying to root out a rumored assassination plot against Kyr'shin, not that he tells that to every person he meets at the party. 

*Successes Required:* 3 successes before 3 failures. 

*Primary Skills:* Bluff (moderate, DC 19), Diplomacy (moderate, DC 19), Insight (moderate, DC 19), Intimidate (moderate, DC 19), Streetsmarts (hard, DC 26)

* After the first success, the PCs confirm there is an assassination plot and the inquisitor will take them into his confidence. 
* After the second success, the details of the plot become clear: the assassins will wear the uniforms of Gea's kingdom when they carry out the attack as a false flag operation to sow discord.  

*Success:* The PCs discover the room where the assassins are hiding out in preparation. Fighting (and hopefully defeating) the assassins takes one interval for all PCs that participate. 

*Failure:* The Inquisitor decides he cannot trust the PCs, and excludes them from the hunt. 



*Dyne*

*Setup:* Dyne is a reclusive academic and an expert on a field of study of current relevance to the PCs. The wedding is their one opportunity to find out more from him. 

*Successes Required:* 3 successes before 3 failures. 

*Primary Skills:* Arcana (moderate, DC 19), Nature (moderate, DC 19), Religion (moderate, DC 19)

Dyne is clearly favoring one leg – he fell from his horse on his way to the wedding but was too proud to ask the hosts for help. If a PC treats his injury (Heal DC 13), the DC for all primary skills falls to easy (DC 13). The Heal success does not count towards total successes. 

*Success:* Dyne agrees to help the PCs with their inquiries. 

*Failure:* The PCs burn their bridges with Dyne. 

**Thresholds:** Unless the PCs (or at least some of the PCs) intercept and defeat the assassins before one hour (the end of the 6th interval), they burst into the main chamber. They try to kill Kyr'shin. Even if the assassins are defeated, the wedding is over and the PCs fail with any players that they had not already achieved 3 successes with. 

The assassins consist of one insidious assassin and one martial artist. 

<figure><img src="pics\EarlGeier_BPORCELAIN.bmp" alt="Porcelain by Earl Geier" style="zoom: 33%;" /><figcaption>Porcelain by Earl Geier</figcaption></figure>

### Crushing Ceiling

**Setup:** The PCs must discover a way to escape the chamber before they are crushed by the room’s slowly descending ceiling.

**Setting:** A 20-foot by 20-foot sealed chamber with a 50-foot high ceiling. The walls, floor, and ceiling are 20-foot by 20-foot slabs of stone (hardness 8, 1,800 hp), and when the extended challenge begins the ceiling-slab begins descending towards the ground at a rate of 5 feet per round. The ceiling slab weighs 1.5 tons (3,000 pounds).

**Level:** 10.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check as a standard action.  

**Successes Required:** 5 successes before 10 rounds elapse. 

**Primary Skills:** Perception (moderate, DC 19), Sleight of Hand (moderate, DC 19)

**Success:** If the PCs succeed before the time pressure concludes, they find a secret door that enables them to escape the room.

**Failure:** If the PCs fail to gain 5 successes before the time pressure ends, the slab attacks all creatures in the room at the end of each round. +15 vs Fortitude; the target is grappled. If the target is already grappled, it takes 10d6+8 damage. Creatures that are not grappled can continue to make skill checks to attempt to find the hidden door, accruing successes towards escaping the room.

**Special:** This is a good challenge to pair with a battle, perhaps with oozes that can squeeze between gaps and are indifferent to the ceiling. 

### Prosecution

**Setup:** The PCs must take on the role of prosecutors in a trial in order to prevent an enemy from acquitting herself. 

**Level:** 11.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes.  

**Successes Required:** 3 successes before 3 failures. 

**Primary Skills:** Up to two characters can participate in the trial itself as advocates: Bluff (moderate, DC 19), Diplomacy (moderate, DC 19), Insight (hard, DC 26)

If a character fails on a Bluff check, the DC of a Diplomacy check increases to hard (DC 26). If a character succeeds on an Insight check, the DC of Diplomacy and Bluff checks decreases to easy (DC 13).

Other characters can attempt the following one-off measures:

*Frighten or bribe the enemy's henchman into telling the truth* (Intimidate, DC 19, or pay 1,000 gold pieces).

*Find incriminating evidence among the opposing counsel's notes* (Perception, DC 26, or Streetsmarts, DC 19). On a success, also remove one failure. 

*Uncover last-minute evidence* (History, DC 19). On a success, can also swap out one of the PCs participating in the trial itself as an advocate. 

**Success:** If the PCs succeed, their enemy is jailed and receives the maximum possible sentence, as appropriate for her crimes.

**Failure:** If the PCs fail, their enemy is left off with minimal sentencing, as they were unable to produce sound enough evidence to incarcerate her. If the PCs failed with no successes, the townsfolk become quickly convinced that they are the true perpetrators of their enemy's crimes and seek to either imprison them or run them out of town. 

### History Lesson at the War College

**Setup:** The PCs must discover the hidden history of the war college if they are to properly defend it against a hobgoblin invasion. 

**Level:** 12.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every day.  

**Successes Required:** 5 successes before 3 failures, and before 5 days elapse. 

**Primary Skills:** History (easy, DC 14), Insight (moderate, DC 20), Sleight of Hand (moderate, DC 20), Streetsmarts (moderate, DC 20) 

**Success:** The PCs are able to discover and address the weakest parts of the college’s defenses.

**Failure:** The college’s defenses are woefully inadequate for the war to come.

**Progression:** Each success imparts a piece of information: 

* The brewmaster at the Fox and Swan believes that red hair is a blessing from the god of war, and frequently offers discounts on masterwork and enchanted weapons to ginger-headed warriors.

* When a local duke was slain in battle, his legendary shield Stalwart was never recovered. It is believed that the hobgoblins’ war chief took it as a trophy.
  
* Detailed blueprints illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the war college. All border forts on the northern frontier were built with similar defenses.

* Scouting reports mention a shield matching Stalwart’s description in the hands of a hobgoblin warlord gathering an army in the nearby hills. It is rumored
  that this new war chief is either the descendant of the shield’s previous hobgoblin master or that she defeated the aging warlord in battle.

* A secret postern gate in the southeast wall of the war college provides access to the guard barracks. The college fell to the goblin army during the last war, and there is evidence that the hobgoblins might attempt the same trick again in the near future.

### Against the Avalanche

**Setup:** The PCs must push their way up to a mountain shrine while an avalanche cascades around them – at the behest of the shrine's guardian, a kami.

**Level:** 13.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes. 

**Successes Required:** Challenge crawl, 4 challenges: 

*Characters must scale the mountain.* Each character must succeed on one of the following checks to progress: Athletics (easy, DC 14), Acrobatics (moderate, DC 21), Endure (moderate, DC 21), Nature (moderate, DC 21).

*Plant life:* The jingushigami uses its ability to control plants to temporarily command a number of plant creatures in the area to impede the PCs. After one character succeeds on a Nature check (moderate, DC 21), all characters can progress. Otherwise, characters progress after waiting 10 minutes.  

*Manipulate terrain:* Frustrated by their advances, the jinushigami uses its *manipulate terrain* power to make the mountain more difficult to traverse. Each character must succeed on one of the following checks to progress: Acrobatics (moderate, DC 21), Athletics (easy, DC 14), Endure (moderate, DC 21), Nature (moderate, DC 21).

*The kami:* Mere feet away from the shrine, the jinushigami emerges to confront the PCs. At this stage, checks take 1 minute – which means this challenge is likely to be resolved in a single 10-minute cycle. The jinushigami begins as unfriendly. 3 successes before 3 failures. On a failure, or if the PCs initiate, the jinushigami attacks. On a success, or when the jinushigami is defeated, all other skill DCs in the challenge crawl drop to easy (DC 14). 

Primary Skills:  Bluff (moderate, DC 21), Diplomacy (easy, DC 14) or Intimidate (hard, DC 28). 

Secondary Skills: History, Nature, Religion. These can be used with aid another to give a bonus to the primary skills. 

**Events:** 

*After the first failure in the crawl,* the jingushigami that has made the mountain its ward triggers an avalanche. Characters that have already succeeded on a check are in the “slide zone”, and suffer an attack: +18 vs Reflex; 4d6 damage, and the target is buried. 

Characters that have not yet succeeded on a check are in the “bury” zone, and suffer an attack: +18 vs Reflex; on a hit, 8d6 damage, and the target is buried. On a miss, 4d6 damage, and the target is buried.  

Characters who are buried must use their check to dig themselves out with an Athletics check (easy, DC 14). Characters who aren’t buried can use their check to dig out one ally, or two if they have an appropriate tool, such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel. 

*After the first success in the “manipulate terrain” challenge,* the jinushigami, enraged, uses its *earthquake* power to attempt to halt the PCs’ progress. Each character is attacked, regardless of their progress: +18 vs Reflex; the target cannot make a check on their next turn. 

### The Omeli Portal  

*A series of old, rusty contraptions decorate the Omeli manor home’s tallest tower, with no evidence of their use of function. However, if one should find Sir Omeli’s old notebooks detailing their use, and if that one should activate the machine during a storm, that one might just find themselves facing what Sir Omeli spent his whole life trying to find: the gateway to Heaven.*  

This incantation is found in Sir Omeli’s notes, and details the workings of the machine in the highest tower of his manor. This machine harnesses power from lightning and, with the aid of a focusing diamond, opens a portal to the Outer Plane of Heaven.  

**Setup:** The PCs are examining the machine in the Omeli manor during an electrical storm.   

**Level:** 15.  

**Check Successes Required:** 6 before 3 failures.  

**Primary Skills:** 

*Sleight of Hand (DC 15):* Your talent at working with traps and other devices allows you to delicately adjust the machinery.   

*Nature (DC 22):* You have a good weather-eye, and you can time the contraption's use to exactly when lightning strikes the manor.   

*History (DC 30):* You remember an obscure detail of Sir Omeli's life, which gives you a clue about how the contraption is meant to operate.   

*Religion (DC 30):* Your knowledge of planar convergences gives you insight into how to set the mechanism.

*Perception (DC 22):* You find the focusing diamond. If the focusing diamond cannot be found, another gem can be used as a substitute but it is destroyed in the process.   

**Special:** An encounter or daily power with the Lightning tag can provide assistance at the nick of time. Once during the challenge, one of these powers can be used to cancel out a failure (it does not turn into a success, however).   

**Success:** The PCs travel to Heaven, appearing at an unpredictable place on the plane.  

While this machine can be used to travel to Heaven, alternate means (or an assistant to open the portal again from the Material Plane side) must be employed to return.  

**Failure:** The machine backfires, flooding the area with radiant energy. All creatures within 100 squares of the machine take 5d10 radiant damage and are blinded for 24 hours.   

### Wake the Forest Watcher  

*Around the forest they tell a local legend, where a girl lost in the forest at night sang and danced to keep away fear. The forest watcher, entranced by her voice and movements, came and showed her the way out. To this day, children who grow up near the forest learn this story and its accompanying song and dance. Outsiders think it a quaint tradition, but the local children know if they are ever lost in the forest, the Forest Watcher may be their only salvation.*  

Use this extended challenge to reflect player characters calling on the mysterious spirit known as the Forest Watcher for assistance.   

**Setup:** The PCs are within the bounds of the forest during night.   

The Forest Watcher may be entreated for directions to anything within or on the edge of the forest, always revealing the shortest path. The Forest Watcher may also be asked questions about what is currently within the forest, although it cannot reveal more than what an observer could discover.  

**Level:** Equal to the average level of the PCs – the Forest Watcher expects better performances from those able to give them.  

**Check Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures.  

**Primary Skills:** Acrobatics, Diplomacy, Nature.  

*Acrobatics (moderate DCs):* You dance elegantly and expertly, impressing the Forest Watcher.  

*Diplomacy (moderate DCs):* You phrase your request to the Forest Watcher in a polite and humble manner.   

*Nature (easy DCs):* You recognize the best part of the forest to make your entreaty from, to be most easily heard by the Forest Watcher.   

**Failure:** All participants are exhausted, losing a recovery. A particularly poor effort may anger the Forest Watcher, leading it to direct creatures of the forest against the PCs.

# Bonds  

Over time, player characters will ingratiate themselves with and derive power from different patrons, powerful magical artifacts, secret societies, and so on. These relationships are often ephemeral, lasting over two or three adventures. In some cases they last longer, particularly if the player character is prepared to keep investing in them.   

Unless otherwise stated, when a character forms one of these bonds, they start with a Favor of 5, which corresponds to a “Neutral” attitude.   

##### Table – Favor and Attitude

| Favor     | Attitude   |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 0 or less | Hostile    |
| 1-4       | Unfriendly |
| 5-11      | Neutral    |
| 12-15     | Friendly   |
| 16-20     | Helpful    |

If the player character serves the bond, it strengthens and Favor increases. If they defy the bond or neglect it, Favor decreases.   

Some example bonds are shown below.   

## Ancient Priesthood  

Prestige-tier bond  

The player character joins a secretive priesthood with its own language. Red in tooth and claw but with a soft spot for mistletoe, these priests worship ancient gods.   

### Favor

Example ways a character may gain or lose Ancient Priesthood Favor:   

*Character gains a level in a divine class* +1d10

*Character is defeated by another in the ancient priesthood* -2  

### Properties

**Sacred Grove:** You are given a grove, circle of dolmens or other sacred place to tend. Those who seek to join the priesthood will seek out a priest in their sacred place and try to kill them, so as to take their place.   

**Learn Incantation:** Upon joining the ancient priesthood, you are taught an incantation. You do not get to choose the incantation. Those with a Friendly bond are taught a second, and Helpful a third. You still need the Incantation Caster feat in order to cast the incantation. 

### Hostile  

**Spiritual Duties:** You must make a blood sacrifice alongside every incantation you perform or the incantation does not work.   

**Obsessed with the Unnatural:** You suffer a -2 penalty on any attack that does not include a creature with the undead or construct tags or the cosmic source.  

### Unfriendly  

**Spiritual Duties**   

**Forest Grace:** Ignore difficult terrain that results from plants and vegetation.   

You leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. You may choose to leave a trail if so desired.

**Forest Grace**

**Nature Sense +5**

**Resist Poison 5**

### Helpful  

Even if your Favor is high enough, you only reach this rank if you defeat an ancient priest already at this rank.

**Forest Grace**

**Nature Sense +5**

**Timeless Body:** You no longer age, and cannot be aged magically.   

**Resist Poison 10**

## Knighthood

### Hostile  

**Powerful Enemies:** Once every month or so, you face an attack, sabotage or arson from one of your enemies. This might take the form of an encounter of your level, or an extended challenge as you try to undo the damage they have done.   

**Render Unto Caesar:** Your liege lord demands 1,000 gp a month in additional tithes – or for you to go on a quest of your lord's choosing every six months.

### Neutral

If you breach an oath, you suffer the same effect.

> **Special** This power does not affect the normal limitation that a character can only take the rally action once per combat.  

### Moving On  

While a player character may well remain a knight for the rest of their life, they may still give up this bond by travelling far away from their lands, by rising to a higher rank with different duties, by leaving their domain in the care of a spouse or regent, and so on. 

Alternatively, they may actually be stripped of their knighthood – perhaps they lied about their pedigree, they were falsely (or fairly) accused of unchivalrous behaviour or there has been a revolution.   

## Revenant

Heroic-tier bond

When you are killed, your Game Master may give you the opportunity to  return as a revenant. You begin with Favor 5. Over time, you can shake  off your revenant nature and return to life fully – or succumb to  hunger and misery and become a revenant for good.

### Friendly

**The True Death:** A creature killed by an attack from Tyrfing cannot be brought back from the dead by any means, nor become an undead creature.   

### Hostile

**Mysterious Whispers:** Once per day, Tyrfing whispers a name to you. You have already or will soon meet this person. You suffer a -2 penalty on any attack that does not include them as a target. If you take a long rest without having killed them, the penalty ends but you start the next day with one fewer recovery.   

**Obsessive:** You suffer a -2 penalty on any skill check that takes more than one round.   

### Unfriendly

**Shield of Souls:** You begin each day with 5 temporary HP (*Level 11:* 10; *Level 21:* 15). Each time you kill a creature, your temporary HP are restored.

### Moving On  

Only when the player character has exhausted their capability for bloodletting, or when Tyrfing senses the opportunity for even greater slaughter in other hands, will Tyrfing move on willingly. 

If a creature could deliver a killing blow to the player character but shows them mercy instead, the player character can cast aside Tyrfing of their own free will.
