## Ancestry Traits  

The description of each ancestry includes traits that are common to members of that ancestry. The following entries appear among the traits of most ancestries.  

### Ability Score Increase(s)  

Every ancestry increases one or more of a character's ability scores.  

### Size  

Characters of most ancestries are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few ancestries are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall).   

### Speed  

Your speed determines how far you can move.  

### Languages  

By virtue of your ancestry, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.  

## Human  

It's hard to make generalizations about humans.  

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall.   

Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Giant curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.  

### Human Traits  

**Ability Score Increases:** +2 to one ability score of your choice  

**Size:** Your size is Medium.  

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.  

**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.   

**Bonus Feat:** Choose one feat. You gain that feat.

**Hardy Stock:** +1 ancestry bonus to Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses.   

**Dabbler:** You have a third level 1 at-will attack power from your class.   

### Variant: True Grit  

Instead of giving humans a third level 1 at-will attack power from their class, GMs may want to offer them the *true grit* power instead – especially if they are taking a class that does not have at-will attack powers. However, GMs should note that *true grit* is unusually powerful for an ancestry power and it overlaps with the elf's *careful focus* power.  

**Human Power:** You have the *true grit* power.

> **Human Utility Ancestry**

# Designing Your Own Ancestries  

While Orcus only comes with a handful of ancestries by default, you can design your own by following the steps below.   

## Ability Score Increases  

Pick three ability scores. A player that chooses that ancestry can choose two of the three abilities to receive a +2 bonus to.  

## Skill Bonuses  

Pick two skills. The ancestry grants a +2 ancestry bonus to each skill.  

## Size, Speed  

By default, ancestries are Medium with a speed of 6. Other options include:  

* Small, speed 5.  
* Small, speed 6.   
* Medium, speed 5, your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.  

## Language  

Common, plus one or two others that make sense.   

## Color Traits  

Choose none, or as many as you like. Adding a couple of color traits to an ancestry can be a way to compensate for underwhelming traits in other areas, like a speed of 5 or one of the weaker minor traits.   

**Additional Language:** Members of this ancestry know an additional language, either one of their player's choice or one shared by all members of the ancestry. 

**Fey Ancestry:** You have the fey tag.

**Trance:** You don't need to sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.

Your 4-hour trance has the same effect as a 6-hour long rest.  

**Undead Ancestry:** You have the undead tag.  

**Web Stride:** Webs, like those from a spider, are not difficult terrain for you.  

**Woodland Stride:** Shrubbery, trees or plants are not difficult terrain for you.

# Advanced Combat  

## Mounted Combat  

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.  

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.  

### Mounting and Dismounting  

You can mount a creature an adjacent creature or dismount into an adjacent, unoccupied space. Mounting or dismounting is a move action. 

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you travel with it. If an effect moves you against your will while mounted, you can choose whether it is moved as well, or whether you fall off it and are moved.   

If your mount is knocked prone, you are dismounted and land in a space within 1 square.  

If you are knocked prone while mounted, immediately make a saving throw. If you fail, you fall prone in a space of your choice within 1 square. If you succeed, you are not knocked prone.   

### Controlling a Mount  

While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, always act independently.  

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. 

You can give up actions to command a controlled mount, in which case it gets to take the same actions. For example, you can give up your standard action in order for the mount to take a standard action. You can also use an immediate action in order for the mount to make an opportunity attack or use a counter or reaction (in all three cases, only if eligible to do so). 

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.  

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.  

## Underwater Combat  

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.  

When making a **weapon attack**, a creature has -2 on the attack roll unless the weapon is in the spears and lances or crossbows weapon groups.  

Powers with the Fire tag have a -2 penalty on attack rolls.   

Creatures with the Aquatic tag get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against creatures without the Aquatic tag.  

## Maneuvers

The maneuvers introduced here are available to all characters, but they are only usable where they make sense in the fiction. In particular, the *damage power source*, *repel* and *lure* powers are intended to be used only where an enemy could lose access to its powers (for example, a gem in its forehead is the source of its energy ray), be repulsed by something (perhaps a clove of garlic brandished at a vampire) or attracted to something (like a tyrannosaurus drawn to a dead cow).

> #### Damage Power Source  
>
> **At-Will** **Standard Action**  
> **Attack Advanced** ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Melee or Ranged** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack:**  Strength or Dexterity vs Fortitude or Reflex (whichever is higher)  
> **Hit:**  Choose one of the target's powers. They cannot use it until it refreshes (roll of 5 or 6 required).

> **Melee** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack:**  Strength or Dexterity vs Fortitude or Reflex (whichever is higher)  
> **Hit:**  The target drops an item of your choice in its space.  
> **Effect:** You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target.  
> **Special:**  A disarmed creature cannot use powers with the Weapon tag that are associated with that weapon. However, if disarmed of a melee weapon, they can always make an unarmed attack with the same attack bonus, doing damage equal to 4 + their level.  

> #### Ignite  
>
> **At-Will** **Standard Action**  
> **Attack Advanced** ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Melee or Ranged** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack:**  Dexterity or Intelligence vs Reflex  
> **Hit:**  The target takes 5 persistent fire damage (save ends). *Level 11:* 10 persistent fire damage. *Level 21:* 15 persistent fire damage.  
> **Special:**  You must have a source of fire to use this power.  

> #### Lure  
>
> **Encounter** **Standard Action**  
> **Attack Advanced** ● **Focus**  
> **Near** burst 5, any vulnerable creatures  
> **Attack:**  Intelligence or Charisma vs Will  
> **Hit:**  Target pulled 5 and immobile (save ends).  
> **Miss:**  You cannot use this power on the same target for the rest of the encounter.  
> **Special:**  Depending on the vulnerability of the creature, the lure might be deployed in a different space to the user.  

> #### Overrun  
>
> **At-Will** **Free Action**  
> **Attack Advanced** ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Melee** 1, one creature  
> **Effect:** Make a secondary attack each time you attempt to enter an enemy's space.   
> *Secondary Attack:* Str vs Fort; push target 1. *Miss:* You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target.  
> **Special:**  This is an exception to the rule that you cannot enter an enemy's space.  

> #### Repel  
>
> **At-Will** **Standard Action**  
> **Attack Advanced** ● **Focus**  
> **Near** burst 2, any vulnerable creatures  
> **Attack:**  Wisdom or Charisma vs Will  
> **Hit:**  Target pushed their speed and immobile until the end of your next turn.  
> **Miss:**  You cannot use this power on the same target for the rest of the encounter.  
> **Special:**  Depending on the vulnerability of the creature, the repellant might be deployed in a different space to the user.  

> #### Sunder  
>
> **At-Will** **Standard Action**  
> **Attack Advanced** ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Melee** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack:**  Strength or Dexterity vs Reflex  
> **Hit:**  Choose an item. If the item is a weapon, armor, shield or enchanted cloak, the bonus granted by that item is reduced by 1 (cumulative). The effect on other items depends on their hardness and make-up.  
> **Effect:** You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target.  

> #### Trip  
>
> **At-Will** **Standard Action**  
> **Attack Advanced** ● **Martial, Weapon**  
> **Melee** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack:**  Strength or Dexterity vs Fortitude or Reflex (whichever is higher)  
> **Hit:**  The target is knocked prone.  
> **Effect:** You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target.  

## New Feats

### Distant Maneuver

**Requirements:** Improved Maneuver

**Benefit:** You can *disarm, trip* or *sunder* using a ranged weapon.  

### Flicking Disarm 

**Requirements:** Improved Maneuver

**Benefit:** When you *disarm* a target, you can choose any unoccupied square adjacent to the target for the item to land in. You can alternatively choose an unoccupied square adjacent to you, provided you are adjacent to the target. 

### Improved Maneuver

**Benefit:** You do not provoke opportunity attacks when you use the *disarm, trip, sunder* or *overrun* powers.

# Objects  

When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.  

For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.  

## Statistics for Objects  

When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.  

***Armor Class***. An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.  

##### Table – Substance's HP Multipliers

| Substance                           | HP Multiplier |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Cloth, paper, rope                  | x 0.1         |
| Crystal, glass, ice / Very delicate | x 0.25        |
| Leather / Delicate                  | x 0.5         |
| Wood, bone                          | 1             |
| Sturdy                              | x 1.5         |
| Stone                               | x 2           |
| Iron, steel                         | x 3           |
| Adamantine                          | x 5           |

***Hit Points***. An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing.  

Objects are immune to poison, psychic and necrotic damage. Will attacks against them automatically fail.   

##### Table – Object's Defenses and Hit Points

| Size                                          | AC / Reflex | Fortitude | HP   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ---- |
| Tiny (bottle, lock)                           | 10          | 5         | 5    |
| Small (chest, lute)                           | 8           | 8         | 10   |
| Medium (barrel, chandelier)                   | 5           | 10        | 20   |
| Large (cart, 10-ft-by-10-ft window)           | 4           | 12        | 40   |
| Huge (tapestry)                               | 3           | 15        | 100  |
| Gargantuan (colossal statue, column of stone) | 2           | 20        | 200  |

# Magic Items  

Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item's description gives the item's name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties.  

## Purchasing Magic Items

What follows are the standard prices for magic items by level. Of course, magic items may be dearer or cheaper in particular markets, or not available for purchase at all. As discussed in the Equipment chapter, magic items typically fetch one-fifth their cost when sold in a market.

## Magic Items on the Body  

Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It’s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as 10 magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.  

A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups (two items from the ring group), keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.  

-   One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the **head**  
-   One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the **neck**, or one cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor)   
-   One robe or suit of **armor** on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)  
-   One belt around the **waist** (over a robe or suit of armor)  
-   One shield, pair of bracers or set of bracelets on the **arms** or wrists  
-   One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the **hands**  
-   One **ring** on each hand (or two rings on one hand)  
-   One pair of boots or shoes on the **feet**  

Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those listed above have no effect.  

Wondrous items can be worn or carried without taking up space on a character’s body.  

## Distributing Magic Items  

GMs can decide for themselves how to distribute magic items in their games, but here are four options to consider.  

### 1. Steady Progression  

A player character should get a new permanent magic item every 12 encounters or so, and that item should be of a level equal to their own level +1 to +4 (roughly 25% chance of each). Since there are roughly 10 encounters to a level, other ways of thinking about this are that:  

1. each level a player character should get 0.8 of a permanent item *or*   
2. each level, a five-adventurer team should get four permanent items *or*  
3. over the course of five levels, a player character should get four permanent magic items.   

In addition, a player character should get gold pieces, trade goods, precious items, consumable magic items and so on equivalent in value to a permanent magic item of their level roughly every 25 encounters or so. Another way of saying that is that every level a player character should get 0.4 of a permanent item in gold pieces, etc.  

Keep in mind that a consumable magic item costs 1/25th as much as a permanent magic item of the same level.   

Assuming a rate of 10 encounters per level, that results in the following average treasure per player character per level (not including permanent magic items).

| 30   | 1,250,000                                  |

### 2. Magic Item Only  

Each level, each character receives one magic item of level +2 or two magic items of level +0. They do not receive any other treasure.   

### 3. Treasure Troves  

Each level, the party should discover about 10 treasure troves of their level. Each treasure trove is randomly generated by rolling 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12 and 1d20, with each result helping to determine the contents of the treasure trove.   

**1d4:** This is the magic item level bonus, see 1d12 below.   

**1d6:** This is the coin multiplier, see 1d20 below.   

**1d8:** On a 5, 6 or 7, the trove contains a number of art objects, see 1d10 below. On an 8, it contains a gemstone. On any other result, it contains nothing. See the table below for the value of the art objects or gemstone by level.   

**1d10:** If the trove contains art objects, this is how many it contains.   

Add 1 to the d10 roll for every additional player character in the party beyond 5, and subtract 1 for every player character that the party is missing below 5 PCs (minimum 0).   

**1d12:** On a 6 or less, the trove contains a personal item or something of significance to the story or adventure but not of monetary value. For example, it could be a note with the evil faction's watchword scribbled on it, a key to a door deeper in the dungeon, the mayor's missing spectacles, a clue to the disappearances by the docks, or just a kobold's pet toad.   

On a 5, 6 or 7, the trove contains a consumable item roughly of the party's level.   

On an 8 or higher, the trove contains a permanent magic item of the party's level plus the 1d4 result.   

Add 1 to the d12 roll for every additional player character in the party beyond 5, and subtract 1 for every player character that the party is missing below 5 PCs (minimum 0).   

**1d20:** On an 11 or more, the trove contains coins. Multiply the 1d6 result by the number of coins shown in the table below for the total number of coins in the trove.   

Add 2 to the d20 roll for every additional player character in the party beyond 5, and subtract 2 for every player character that the party is missing below 5 PCs.

### 4. Narrative Play

The PCs get treasure when they earn it; depending on the skill, strategy and daring they show, they might accumulate more *+1 swords* than they know what to do with, or they might be penniless and fighting off owlbears with a rusty breadknife. 

The game mechanics behind Orcus assume that PCs, at least once they have a few levels under their belts, will have at least three magic items of roughly their level or a few levels higher: a magic weapon or focus, magic armor (or magic clothes for those who don't wear armor) and a magic cloak (or amulet). That's because the game math depends on PCs picking up +6 in bonuses from magic items over the 30 levels of their adventuring careers. 

Some character concepts may require more magic items. For example, a warrior-mage might need a magic weapon and a magic focus, and a skirmisher who fights at range and melee will need two magic weapons – as will a fighter who dual-wields. Characters may also need healing potions, especially if they do not have a dedicated healer, and without the boost other magic items give they will find themselves a little behind when facing challenges of their level. 

Now you, as the Game Master, know the mathematical assumptions, you can decide whether to break them, and how. 

## Enchanted Items  

There are four core types of magic item, called enchanted items:   

* Cloaks or amulets worn about the neck, which increase Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses.  
* Weapons  
* Focuses  
* Armor (or “cloth armor”, i.e. robes and other clothing, for those who do not wear armor)  

A character may need both an enchanted focus and an enchanted weapon, if they are for example a cleric that casts spells using a holy symbol and makes attacks with a mace. A character may need two weapons, if they dual-wield or mix it up between ranged and melee. Otherwise, a character only needs either an enchanted weapon or an enchanted focus, not both.   

Enchanted items give an enhancement bonus – so a +1 enchanted cloak gives a +1 enhancement bonus to Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses, while a +3 enchanted sword gives a +3 enhancement bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls, and +3d6 damage on a weapon critical hit. +2 enchanted armor gives a +2 enhancement bonus to Armor Class, and a +6 enchanted focus gives a +6 enhancement bonus to spell attack and damage rolls, and +6d6 damage on a spell critical hit.   

### Boosted Enchanted Items  

Some enchanted items do nothing extra. However, others have been boosted. There are four tiers of boost: I through IV, which increase the level of the enchanted item by that amount. So, for example, a +1 sword is level 1, but a +1 sword (boost II) is level 3. A +3 sword is level 11, but a +3 sword (boost II) is level 13.

One command word causes the box to unfold into a skiff (see the Vehicles chapter). 

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship  (see the Vehicles chapter).

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.  

The third command word causes the *folding boat* to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.  

### Horseshoes of a Zephyr

### Horseshoes of Speed  

*Level 10*

### Immovable Rod  

*Level 8*  

This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use a swift action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses a swift action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Athletics check, moving the fixed rod up to 2 squares on a success.  

### Instant Fortress  

*Level 24*  

You can use a standard action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.  

The fortress is a square tower, 4 squares on a side and 6 squares high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a swift action. It is immune to magical effects that would open it or make it easier to open.  

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance 15 to all other damage.

### Portable Hole  

*Level 9*  

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  

You can use a standard action to unfold a *portable hole* and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the *portable hole* creates an extradimensional hole 2 squares deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open *portable hole* can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  

You can use a standard action to close a *portable hole* by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Athletics check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 1 square of the *portable hole* or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed *portable hole* can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.  

Placing a *portable hole* inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag of holding*, *handy haversack*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 2 squares of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.  

### Spiritlink Charm

## Poisons  

Poisons are “masterwork consumables”, which just means they cost double that of a normal consumable item of their level.

Poisons can either be used in combat as powers, or if the poisoner gets an opportunity to expose the target to the poison more extensively (by feeding it to them, storing it in a container that the target opens, placing it on their clothes, etc.) then the target can suffer a more serious effect.

# Backgrounds  

Backgrounds describe training or environments your character experienced before becoming an adventurer. Backgrounds appear in this book because they are an optional rule.

Backgrounds allow you to customize your character based on their life before adventuring.  

Your character’s background can help you learn or portray more about their personality while also suggesting what sorts of things they’re likely to know. Consider what events set your character on their path to the life of an adventurer and how those circumstances relate to their background.  

When you select a background, you can select **one** of the following benefits (unless another option is specified in the background):  

1. You learn a new language that the GM agrees seems related to that background.  
2. You add one of the skills associated with the background to your list of class skills.  
3. You get a +2 bonus to one of the skills associated with the background.

# Arts

Arts are things that your character can do over an extended period of time – at least minutes, up to weeks or months in the case of the most elaborate arts. You must learn an art, which typically costs money (the “cost to learn”) and takes time. Then using the art requires you to spend the time specified under its “completion time” and expending the money or other resources listed under “component cost”.

Most arts are associated with a skill. You must be trained in that skill to learn that art.

## Types of Art

There are two main types of art: practices and incantations. Practices are often non-magical, although they can involve feats that go beyond ordinary human abilities into the realm of legend. Incantations are more explicitly magical – they are spell-like practices, although they can be learned and used (“cast”) by characters who are not otherwise spellcasters. 

There are special rules relating to incantations, described below. 

## Practices

Practices typically take 8 to 24 hours to learn (8 for heroic-tier arts, 16 for prestige-tier and 24 for epic-tier).

### Types of Practice

* Schema: Schemas allow you to make, brew or craft items. Often, a schema practice unlocks the ability to learn many different schemas. For example, the Craft Trap practice encompasses one schema for each trap. 
* Lesson: Lessons allow you to teach an ability to another. 
* Treatment: Treatments are curative practices. 
* Information: Information practices tell you something about yourself or the world. 
* Trick: Tricks are are a miscellaneous category. 
* Interaction: Interaction practices involve talking to or otherwise engaging with other creatures. 

## Incantations  

Spell-like arts are called incantations. Incantations can be learned and used (“cast”) by characters who are not spellcasters. Characters who know the correct gestures and phrases for an incantation can achieve powerful magic effects.   

Incantations have drawbacks: They’re time-consuming to cast, and success is not always assured. They are often expensive, and some incantations work only under certain specific conditions, such as during a full moon.  

Sometimes, an incantation that is incorrectly cast reverses itself on the caster, explodes with a cascade of magical energy, or weakens the barrier between worlds, enabling hostile outsiders to emerge onto the Material Plane.  

Incantations provide a useful way to introduce powerful magical effects in a lower-level game under controlled conditions. PCs will still use spells rather than expensive, risky incantations whenever they can. Incantations are also more specific than spells, so the GM can introduce them into the game without worrying that they’ll spread beyond the immediate situation.  

### Discovering Incantations

Obscure tomes and spellbooks filled with mystical ramblings, descriptions of magic theory, ordinary arcane spells, and utterly useless or incomprehensible magical writing often hide the instructions for performing incantations. In those dusty volumes, diligent readers can find incantations with real power—magical recipes that provide step-by-step instructions for achieving a powerful effect.  

Incantations can be recorded in a spellbook, even if the user does not normally use a spellbook. A spellbook fits one level of incantation per page (so a level 9 incantation takes up 9 pages). Copying an incantation from one book to another costs the same amount as buying the incantation, and takes eight to 24 hours (for adventurer-tier, prestige-tier and epic-tier incantations respectively).  

### Incantation Scrolls  

For the same cost as acquiring an incantation, a character can purchase a scroll that contains an abbreviated version of the incantation. It can be cast in half the time, and does not require the Incantation Caster feat to cast. You still need to pay any of the costs involved, including the components, and make the check. Secondary casters can still participate.   

### Variant: Failed Incantations  

For one reason or another, a GM may decide that an incantation has failed or backfired. Some ideas for how it could backfire are given below:   

**Attack:** A creature is called from elsewhere to battle the caster (and often any bystanders and secondary casters).   

**Augment:** The incantation was supposed to weaken or destroy its target, but it makes the target more powerful instead. An incantation that deals damage might heal its target or cause it to grow in power, for example.  

**Betrayal:** The incantation seemingly succeeds, but the subject of the incantation (or, in rare cases, the caster) undergoes a dramatic alignment change. Over the next 1d6 minutes, the subject’s alignment becomes the extreme opposite of what it was previously (for instance, lawful good becomes chaotic evil; an unaligned subject randomly becomes lawful good, evil, good, or chaotic evil). The subject generally tries to keep its new outlook a secret.  

**Damage:** Either the caster or the target takes damage as the consequence of failure.  

**Death:** Someone—usually the caster or the target—dies. Some incantations allow a saving throw to avoid this consequence of failure.  

**Delusion:** The caster believes the incantation had the desired effect, but in fact it had no effect or a very different one.  

**Falsehood:** The incantation (typically a divination) delivers false results to the caster, but the caster believes the results are true.  

**Mirrorcast:** The incantation has the opposite effect of what was intended.  

**Reversal:** The incantation affects the caster rather than the intended target.  

### Types of Incantation  

* Abjuration   
* Curative   
* Illusion  
* Divination  
* Practical   
* Transportation  
* Crafting   
* Conjuration   
* Scrying  

## Using an Art  

### Interrupting Arts  

Arts take a long time to use. If the art is interrupted, you have to start again but none of the components are used up.   

### Taking 10  

You cannot take 10 on any skill checks associated with an art.   

### Level  

You must be the same or higher level than an art to use it.  

## Component Cost  

Most arts require materials. Others require the user to spend a recovery. Unless otherwise mentioned, this is just like spending a recovery to heal HP, except the user regains no HP.    

## Secondary Users  

Arts allow for additional participants, unless otherwise mentioned. They must be physically present at the art, but do not have to have the relevant skill. They can pay the recovery cost of an art, if any. Secondary users can also help the primary user succeed on skill checks (if any are required) by means of the Aid Another action.   

## Rules Variant: Gated Arts

In this rules variant, you must have a relevant feat before you can learn arts.

### Incantation Caster

**Prerequisite:** Training in Arcana or Religion.   
**Benefit:** You can learn and use Arcana, Religion, Heal and Nature incantations. You can use these incantations even if you are not trained in the relevant skill. 

### Practical Arts

**Benefit:** You can learn and use practices. However, you must be trained in the relevant skill (where applicable) to learn a practice.

## Arcana  

### Detect Magic  

Level 1 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 14  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.  

The incantation can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.  

### Floating Disk  

Level 1 Crafting Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A drop of mercury (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

This incantation creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the incantation ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.  

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.  

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the incantation ends.  

### Illusory Script  

Level 1 Illusion Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A lead-based ink (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 10 days  

You hide a message on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material.  

To you and any creatures familiar with your technique, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.  

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.  

### Identify  

Level 1 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A pearl (28 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the incantation. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any incantations are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a incantation or incantation, you learn which incantation or incantation created it.  

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what incantations, if any, are currently affecting it.  

### Unseen Servant  

Level 1 Conjuration Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A piece of string, a bit of wood and a glass bauble (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

This incantation creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the incantation ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the incantation ends.  

Once on each of your turns as a swift action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 3 squares and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.  

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 12 squares away from you, the incantation ends.  

### Understand Languages  

Level 1 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A pinch of soot and salt and an amethyst (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.  

This incantation doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.  

### Alarm  

Level 1 Abjuration Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 4-space cube. Until the incantation ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the incantation, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.  

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.  

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.  

### Mage's Mark  

Level 1 Transmutation Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 minute  
**Components:** Fresh candle and silver stylus (28 gp)  
**Duration:** Permanent  

Every mage has their own mark, usually an elaborate and unique rune. This ritual allows a mage to inscribe their mark on any non-magical substance, including stone and metal. The rune remains permanently upon the surface, only disappearing if the item or surface itself is destroyed. The mage may choose to make this mark visible to all, or only to those with the sight (meaning that most folk will not be able to see it at all, but anyone with Arcana training will see it).

In order to make their mark, a mage must light a fresh candle and stand it upon the surface to be marked in its own wax. They then prick their finger with a silver stylus and draw their rune upon the surface, very slowly and deliberately, with their own blood, seven times. Upon the seventh and final drawing, the blood fades, the candle falls away, the stylus cracks, and the mark is finished.  

### Sphere of Silence  

Level 3 Illusion Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 27  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a incantation that includes a verbal component is impossible there.  

### Perpetual Message  

Level 3 Illusion Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A small bit of honeycomb and jade dust (54 gp)  
**Duration:** Permanent  

You implant a message within an object within 30 feet, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the incantation to deliver your message.  

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this incantation, you can have the incantation end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.  

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.  

### Meld into Stone  

Level 5 Practical Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 40  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.  

While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Perception checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast incantations on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the incantation. You otherwise can't move.  

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.  

### Spectral Steed  

Level 5 Crafting Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 40  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the incantation vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.  

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 20 squares and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the incantation ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The incantation ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.  

### Liquid Tread  

Level 5 Transportation Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A piece of cork and 40 gp  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

This incantation grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.  

If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the incantation carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 12 squares per round.  

### Sorcerous Gills  

Level 5 Practical Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A short reed or piece of straw, and 40 gp  
**Duration:** 24 hours  

This incantation grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the incantation ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.  

### Tiny Hut  

Level 5 Crafting Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A small crystal bead (40 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

A 10-foot radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The incantation ends if you leave its area.  

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The incantation fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this incantation can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. incantations and other magical effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.  

Until the incantation ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.  

### Continual Flame  

Level 5 Crafting Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Ruby dust (80 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A *continual flame* can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.  

### Hidden Magic  

Level 6 Trick Practice (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 72  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** 72  
**Duration:** One day  

You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical.  

### Contact Other Plane  

Level 9 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 168  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 168  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this incantation, make a DC 25 Arcana check. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A *greater restoration* incantation cast on you ends this effect.  

On a successful check, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the incantation ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.  

### Summon Item  

Level 11 Conjuration Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A sapphire (720 gp)  
**Duration:** Permanent  

You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The incantation leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this incantation, you must use a different sapphire.  

At any time thereafter, you can use your standard action to speak the item's name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the incantation ends.  

If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn't transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.  

*Dispel magic* or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this incantation's effect.  

### Hrothgar's Journey  

Level 11 Transportation Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A windowless, thatched hut in a forest (360 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Hrothgar’s journey is an incantation based on the tale of Hrothgar, a powerful barbarian hero from ages past. When the poetic epic of Hrothgar is recited in the stifling heat of a sweat lodge during the winter solstice, the orator and his listeners receive the same final reward that Hrothgar did: a one-way trip to Asgard’s Valhalla, where they can drink and make merry with the greatest warriors of myth.  

To cast the incantation, the caster must construct a small, windowless hut in the middle of the forest, then build a bonfire in the hut’s center. At least four and up to twelve others accompany the caster into the hut. Other participants must provide the dialogue for other characters in the epic of Hrothgar. Then the flames are lit and the telling of the tale of Hrothgar begins.  

Because the bonfire is large and the hut is small, the atmosphere inside quickly gets stiflingly hot. Any creature inside the hut must make an Endure check (DC 20) every 10 minutes or suffer the effects of severe heat.  

Just as the tale of Hrothgar approaches its conclusion (near the end of the casting time), the bonfire’s flames light the hut on fire, which creates a great deal of smoke but no additional heat or damage. The flames consume the hut’s roof and walls, revealing Valhalla on the plane of Asgard.  

### Call Forth the Dweller  

Level 11 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Forty-two mystic symbols inscribed around the perimeter of the focus doorway (requiring materials costing 360 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

This incantation contacts the enigmatic, extradimensional being known as the Dweller on the Threshold, an entity that imparts knowledge about its specific obsession: doors and other entrances.  

To cast call forth the Dweller, the caster must inscribe forty-two mystic symbols around an open doorway (the “focus”), then begin the chants and supplications required for the incantation.  

If the incantation succeeds, an image of the Dweller—an inky mass of tentacles and mouths—appears on the other side of the doorway. The Dweller on the Threshold truthfully answers any questions it is asked about a particular door. For example, the Dweller can provide a magical password that unlocks a door, indicate how to disarm a trap on a door, reveal the weaknesses of a door’s guardian, or describe the room that lies beyond the door. Its answers are clear and fairly specific, if somewhat terse. The caster may well appreciate such concise answers, because one of the forty-two symbols inscribed around the doorway during the casting of the incantation fades away with each word the Dweller on the Threshold speaks—and when all the symbols are gone, the Dweller disappears.  

If the caster asks the Dweller on the Threshold a question that doesn’t involve doors, the Dweller responds with a cutting insult, often about something the caster thought was secret. Each word of the insult likewise makes a symbol disappear from the perimeter of the doorway.  

The exact nature of the Dweller on the Threshold is shrouded in mystery. Some contend that it is somehow connected to the god of secrets, although no one has ever found conclusive evidence that the Dweller on the Threshold is evil.  

### Telepathic Bond  

Level 11 Divination Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures, one rare (360 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice in the area, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this incantation.  

Until the incantation ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.  

### Plane Walk  

Level 13 Transportation Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 680  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A forked, metal rod (680 gp), attuned to a particular plane of existence  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, and you appear in or near that destination.   

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this incantation can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.  

### Moving Castle  

Level 21 Practical Incantation (Arcana)  

**Cost to Learn:** 9000  
**Completion Time:** 24 hours  
**Components:** 18000  
**Duration:** Permanent  

Select a dwelling of size somewhere between a hut and a small castle. The dwelling lifts itself off the ground and grows one of the following means of transport:   

* **Levitation:** The dwelling floats over the ground and over water, giving it fly 6 (hover, maximum altitude 2).  
* **Chicken Legs:** The dwelling runs along the ground, giving it speed 12.    
* **Rollers:** The dwelling moves on treads on the ground, giving it speed 8 – but it ignores difficult, obstructing and other terrain.   

The dwelling follows your spoken instructions if they are given from within or just outside the dwelling, about as faithfully as a dim but well-meaning dog might.  

## Athletics  

### Weight Distribution

### Use Magic Device  

Level 2 Trick Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 21  
**Completion Time:** *  
**Components:** 1 recovery  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You use a magic item or other magical device even if you do not meet the prerequisites to do so. You must succeed on a Bluff check (DC 15 + half the level of the magic item or device) in order to do so. If you fail, there may be negative consequences depending on the item or device. The completion time is double the normal time it takes to activate the item.  

### Social Identity  

Level 6 Trick Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 72  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** 144 gp of bribes, materials, etc.  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You create a social identity, with its own name, alignment, and abilities. This identity is not a false front; you really are your social identity as well as your original identity, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other. 

Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.

Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Researching one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the research knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.  

### Safe House  

Level 11 Trick Practice (Bluff)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** 720

You establish a safe house—a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands by one 10-foot cube each time you use this craft.  

## Diplomacy

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 week

### Swear an Oath  

Level 1 Interaction Practice (Diplomacy)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 1 recovery  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

To swear an oath, you name—very specifically—a task you will accomplish in no more than one year’s time. If the task is not completed in that time, or if conditions arise that indicate the failure of the oath, you lose all your recoveries, and cannot regain them for a month. 

You cannot be tricked into thinking an oath is fulfilled when it is not, and no magical compulsion can force you to stop attempting to fulfill it. 

Oaths can be singular tasks (destroy the Dark Tower) or ongoing (keep King Dari alive). Ongoing oaths can be renewed at the end of each year. An oath must be something measurable, so the character knows whether it has been fulfilled. 

You receive a +2 power bonus on skill checks while working towards your oath, and a +2 power bonus to defenses against attacks that would stop you from working towards your oath.  

### Entourage  

Level 7 Interaction Practice (Diplomacy)

You have a small group of admirers who tend to follow you around while you’re in civilized settlements. Your admirers are helpful to you, allowing you to make simple requests of them such as purchasing basic equipment with your funds or finding a room at an inn. These admirers do not travel with you to places that are obviously dangerous, including most adventure locations, but they’ll wait for you at the nearest settlement.  

### Geas  

Level 11 Interaction Practice (Diplomacy)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 1 recovery (until effect ends)  
**Duration:** One day / level or until discharged  

A geas places a command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must be of your level or lower and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the craft remains in effect for a maximum of one day per level you have. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas for 24 hours, it loses one recovery per day. It cannot regain these recoveries while the geas remains.

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** embalming fluids (14 gp)  
**Duration:** 10 days  

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.

The craft also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this incantation don’t count against the time limit of crafts and incantations such as *raise dead*.  

### Preserve Corpse  

Level 3 Curative Incantation (Heal)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A pinch of salt and one special coin placed on each of the corpse's eyes, which must remain there for the duration (27 gp)  
**Duration:** 10 days  

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become undead.

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM's discretion.  

### Teach Trick  

Level 1 Lesson Practice (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 14  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** *  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Animals and other unintelligent creatures can be taught a trick using this method. The component cost equals the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level. An animal can be taught multiple tricks over the week, but multiply the component cost by the number of tricks taught. 

* Attack: The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) takes twice as long.
* Come: The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.
* Defend: The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.
* Down: The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.
* Fetch: The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.
* Guard: The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.
* Heel: The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.
* Perform: The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.
* Seek: The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.
* Stay: The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.
* Track: The animal tracks the scent presented to it. 
* Work: The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.

### Spirit Speaker  

Level 2 Divination Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 21  
**Completion Time:** 10 minutes  
**Components:** Incense (21 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 minute  

You know that when an animal dies, its spirit lingers briefly before moving on. Using low chants, body language that shows respect, and special movements that demonstrate to the spirit that you are an ally, you glean information from a spirit before it departs. You ask one simple question of the spirit. Attempt a Nature check at a DC determined by the GM (normally, this is the appropriate DC for the level of the animal or beast when it was alive). Regardless of the result of your check, the spirit immediately departs and can't be used for Spirit Speaker again. 

If you succeed, the spirit answers you truthfully. The spirit's answer is likely to be terse or cryptic compared to normal communication with an animal, and it can pertain only to things the creature directly experienced or considered important. The spirit doesn't remember anything that happened more than 1 day ago.

If you fail, the spirit doesn't answer you. If you fail by 10 or more, the spirit is wracked with misery or bewilderment and gives you an erroneous answer.  

### Locate Animals or Plants  

Level 3 Scrying Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A bit of fur from a bloodhound and a silver dowsing rod (27 gp)

Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant. Concentrating on the voice of nature in your surroundings, you learn the direction and distance to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles, if any are present.  

### Animal Message  

Level 3 Conjuration Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 27  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A morsel of food and a fossil (27 gp)  
**Duration:** Special  

By means of this incantation, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the incantation toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.  

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the incantation ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this incantation.  

***Nature Check***. The duration of the incantation is your Nature check result in hours.  

### Speak with Plants  

Level 5 Divination Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 40  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events within 30 feet within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.  

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.  

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM's discretion. The incantation doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.  

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.  

### Bonded Companion  

Level 5 Practical Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 8 hours  
**Components:** An item with special significance to both participants  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You perform this incantation over two participants: the master and the bonded companion. You may include yourself in the incancation as the master, if desired.   

The bonded companion follows the Companion rules, as well as the following special rules: 

* If the master takes a move action, the companion can take a move action as well.  
* If the master is incapacitated or not present, the companion gets its full complement of actions without needing to be “commanded”.    

* The companion's level is equal to the master's, unless it was already higher.  
* The companion's maximum HP are equal to the master's staggered value, unless it was already higher.   
* The companion uses the master's defenses, except where the companion's defense is higher.
* The companion has no recoveries of its own, but can use its master's.   

* Either participant in the incantation can end its effects as a swift action.

**Cost to Learn:** 72  
**Completion Time:** 1 minute  
**Components:** 1 recovery  
**Duration:** One day  

You know how to encourage your mount to cover ground quickly. When calculating your travel speed for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature check increase your mount's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based on the mount's level or the difficulty of the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your mount's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your mount's movement in encounters.  

### Consult Nature  

Level 9 Divination Incantation (Nature)  

**Cost to Learn:** 168  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 168  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the incantation gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The incantation doesn't function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.  

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:  

- terrain and bodies of water  
- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples  
- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead  
- influence from other planes of existence  
- buildings

**Cost to Learn:** *  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** *  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Each enchanted item boost (dragonbane weapon, dismissal focus, amulet of shielding, etc.) has its own schema, which a character can learn after studying another of the same variety for 1 hour, or from scratch with 8 hours. The cost to learn equals the cost of a consumable item of the level of a +1 item with that boost. The component cost to make one of those magic items equal the cost to buy the item. If an existing enchanted item is consumed during the crafting process, deduct its cost from the component cost.  

### Craft Wondrous Items  

Level 2 Schema Practice (None)  

**Cost to Learn:** *  
**Completion Time:** 1 week  
**Components:** *  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Specially marked sticks (27 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:  

- *Weal*, for good results  
- *Woe*, for bad results  
- *Weal and woe*, for both good and bad results  
- *Nothing*, for results that aren't especially good or bad  

The incantation doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome.  

If you cast the incantation two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.  

### Remove Curse  

Level 5 Curative Practice (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** 80  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

### Speak with the Departed  

Level 5 Divination Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 40  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Burning incense (40 gp)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The incantation fails if the corpse was the target of this incantation within the last 10 days.  

Until the incantation ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This incantation doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.  

### Divination  

Level 9 Divination Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 168  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion (168 gp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.  

The incantation doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome.  

If you cast the incantation two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.  

### Commune  

Level 9 Divination Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 168  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** Incense and a vial of holy or unholy water (168 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the incantation ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.  

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.  

If you cast the incantation two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.  

### Forbid Intrusion  

Level 11 Abjuration Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360  
**Completion Time:** 1 hour  
**Components:** A sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby (360 gp)  
**Duration:** 1 day  

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the *gate* incantation, to enter the area. The incantation proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Plane of Faerie, Plane of Shadow, or the *plane walk* incantation.  

In addition, the incantation damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the incantation's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this incantation).  

When you cast this incantation, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the incantation.  

The incantation's area can't overlap with the area of another *forbiddance* incantation. If you cast *forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same location, the incantation lasts until it is diincantationed, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.  

### Fires of Hell  

Level 11 Conjuration Incantation (Religion)  

**Cost to Learn:** 360  
**Completion Time:** 2 hours  
**Components:** Rare unguents and dark alchemical concoctions (360 gp)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  

This incantation, dreamed up by insane cultists, opens a fell rift between the Material Plane and the fiery second layer of Hell. This rift brings about a massive conflagration that destroys almost everything in the immediate area, then releases a powerful devil who capers over the smoldering ruins and begins to rampage across the countryside. The fires of Hell ignite everything they touch—except for the caster, who is knocked unconscious and transported to the second layer of Hell.  

When the incantation is complete, the fires of Hell fill a 16-square-radius spread around the caster’s former location, dealing 18d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects. Additionally, everything flammable in that radius is now on fire.  

In the following round, a pit fiend comes through the rift, which then closes. The creature begins to destroy everything in sight.  

## Sleight of Hand

**Completion Time:** 1 hour

**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You spread rumors, which may or may not be true, about a specific subject. If the subject of your rumor is not currently the subject of any contradictory rumors, this typically takes 2 hours, at the end of which you make a Streetsmarts check to see how well you spread the rumor. If your rumor matches any current rumors about the subject, it takes less time to spread the rumor, and if you are attempting to overtake a particularly popular and contradictory rumor, it takes much longer or may be impossible. The DC similarly increases or decreases depending on how plausible your rumor is. If you succeed, you successfully spread the rumor. If you fail, your rumor dies off. If you fail by 10 or more, a rumor spreads about someone trying to spread false rumors about the subject.    

# Extended Challenges  

With most skill checks, a single die roll immediately determines whether or not a character succeeds. If a character wants to jump across a chasm or recall a specific piece of information, his success or failure is apparent after a single check.  

For complicated and time-consuming tasks (such as disabling a very complex trap, crafting a powerful artifact or researching an obscure bit of knowledge), or at times when the Game Master wants to build tension and suspense, an extended challenge might be called for. 

### Basic rules

At their simplest, you can design an extended challenge using the following rules: 

An extended challenge is a series of interconnected skill checks, in which the player characters try to succeed on some number of checks before failing three checks, in order to achieve an objective.   

In such a case, a specific number of successful skill checks must be achieved to complete the task. The complexity of the task is reflected in the number of successful rolls required to complete the task, and the maximum number of failed rolls that can occur before the attempt fails. In most cases, one or two failed rolls does not mean that an extended challenge has failed, but if three failed rolls occur before the character makes the required number of successful rolls, the attempt fails. Although three failures is a common baseline, Game Masters are encouraged to change the number if the situation warrants it.  

Extended challenges allow the Game Master to build suspense in critical situations, add tension to multiple-round tasks during combat, enhance special adventure-specific tasks, and resolve complex activities more quickly.  

Succeeding or failing the challenge typically determines whether achieving the objective comes at a cost, not whether the objective is achieved. In some cases, each success represents progress towards the objective, and failing the challenge just means missing out on all the available progress.   

Every extended challenge has a level, which determines the check DCs (different skills may attract Easy, Moderate or Hard DCs as appropriate for that level). Usually the level is set to the level of the PCs. Typically group checks use the Easy DC, the first check with a particular skill uses the Moderate DC and subsequent checks with that skill use the Hard DC. While skills are provided, they should never replace the narrative. For example, if an extended challenge requires an Athletics check to climb a wall, a character that can fly or levitate simply succeeds.   

Whether they succeed or fail, PCs earn the XP specified for the extended challenge, often equivalent to each PC defeating one standard monster of that level.   

All PCs should participate, but not necessarily by making skill checks. They can also use the aid another action to assist an ally's check. A failed aid another check does not count as a failure.   

### Expanding extended challenges

Some special rules may apply to a particular challenge, e.g.:   

* on a failed challenge, each PC loses a recovery   
* certain skills can only be attempted once or twice   
* use of an encounter or daily power can serve as a success by itself   
* use of a consumable item or payment of gold pieces can serve as a success by itself   
* the outcome depends on which specific skills were used   
* a successful check removes a failure instead of adding a success  
* a successful check adds a bonus or reroll to another check instead of adding a success  
* the challenge has multiple stages, with different checks and outcomes in each one   
* missing a check DC causes a complication rather than a failure that counts towards the three   
* the threshold is greater or fewer than three failures  
* the challenge takes place during a combat (only 4-6 successes should be required in this case, replacing 1-2 standard monsters)  

In the example extended challenges that follow, you will find some that work with the basic rules described above, and others that extend the medium. 

## Example Extended Challenges  

### Babysitting

**Setup:** The PCs are watching the three children of two affluent nobles while they attend an annual gala. By ensuring the safety of the children, the PCs hope to earn a favor from the nobles.

**Level:** 1.

**Check Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes. If one hour passes without the requisite successes, the extended challenge fails as the nobles return from the gala. 

**Primary Skills:** Acrobatics (moderate, DC 12), Diplomacy (hard, DC 18), Insight (difficult, DC 18), Intimidate (moderate, DC 12), Perception (difficult, DC 18), Sleight of Hand (moderate, DC 12).

**Failure:** The nobles require a fee to perform the favor. A particularly poor effort at looking after the kids may anger the nobles, leading them to refuse to help point blank, or even create a lasting enmity. 

**Backlash:** PCs that fail a check by 10 points or more lead to the children acting up. Choose one, or make up one based on how the PCs have been amusing the children: 

* *Escapees:* The children escape. The children must be recovered before any further checks are made; a Streetsmarts check (moderate, DC 12) is one way to recover them. 
* *Blackmail:* The children start playing piggy in the middle with a vase, on the marble floor of the foyer. If the PCs handle things poorly, the vase falls and breaks in two. This counts as one failure unless the PCs patch things up (literally or figuratively). 

### Missing Sage

**Setup:** The PCs must research the personal study of a missing town sage to search for clues regarding his disappearance.

**Level:** 2.

**Check Successes Required:** 5 before 3 failures. 

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check each day. If five days pass without the requisite successes, the extended challenge fails. 

**Primary Skills:** History (moderate, DC 13), Insight (hard, DC 19), Nature (moderate, DC 13), Perception (hard, DC 19), Streetsmarts (moderate, DC 13).

**Success:** The leader of the bandits in the woods outside town claims to be the deposed lord of the neighboring barony, and wants to raise an army to take back his title and lands. The sage’s notes indicate that he was planning on seeking out this bandit lord and using his records to prove the veracity of the claim.

**Failure:** The sage suffers a gruesome fate at the hands of the bandit leader—if he isn’t dead, he’s certainly unable to offer them much assistance for a time, if ever.

**Backlash:** PCs that fail on relevant checks learn one of the following pieces of gossip, which may or may not be true:

* At low tide, a hidden entrance to underground caverns becomes visible beneath the town’s docks. According to a number of local legends, pirates hid their booty in the caves. 
* The flower seller in the town square is the local priest’s illegitimate daughter. Given the priest’s vow of chastity, if this knowledge became public, he could lose respect among the townsfolk and likely his position as the town’s priest.

PCs that succeed on their checks may also learn the gossip, but they realize it is not germane to the current challenge. 

### Powering the Runestone

**Setup:** The PCs must reactivate a failed runestone in order to dismiss an eldritch horror attacking the village (like a blood-drinker hag, shadow drake or umbral mass).

**Level:** 3.

**Check Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures. 

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check as a standard action. If one minute passes without the requisite successes, the extended challenge fails. 

**Primary Skills:** Arcana (easy, DC 9)

**Success:** The PCs reactivate the runestone, dismissing the eldritch horror.  

**Failure:** If the PCs fail to reactivate the runestone, a blast of destructive energies wreck the PCs and the eldritch horror remains in the world. 

*Attack:* Near burst 5, +8 vs Reflex; 2d8+3 points of damage. 

**Backlash:** Failing a skill check by 5 or more causes the runestone to lash out with eldritch power, dealing 1d8+1 points of force damage to the person who failed the check. 

*Secondary Attack:* +8 vs Will; the target is stunned until the end of their next turn.  

### Crossing the Bridge

**Setup:** The PCs must make their way across the chasm’s bridge without damaging the bridge’s integrity or risk falling.

**Level:** 4.

**Successes Required:** Each character must cross before a total of 3 failures. 

**Distance:** The bridge is 100 feet long (20 squares) and 5 feet wide (1 square).  

**Primary Skills:** Acrobatics (easy, DC 10) after each move action

Characters move as normal across the bridge, but if they fail the Acrobatics check then the bridge becomes difficult terrain until the end of their next turn as it shakes and twists. 

If the bridge is already difficult terrain and a character fails their Acrobatics check, all characters on the bridge suffer an attack: +9 vs Reflex; on a hit, the target falls prone. 

**Success:** The PCs cross the bridge. 

**Failure:** The bridge breaks in the middle. All characters on the bridge suffer an attack: +9 vs Reflex; on a hit, the target falls 40 feet to the base of the chasm. On a miss, the target grabs hold of the bridge and can climb up (Athletics, DC 10). 

Characters that fall into the chasm must use Athletics (DC 10) to climb up the stretch of bridge to one side of the chasm or the other. 

**Extra:** A character in the 2-square stretch in the middle of the bridge can make a Sleight of Hand check (DC 14) to increase the number of failures before the extended challenge is a failure to 4. A failure on this check counts towards total failures, however.  

**Special:** This is a good challenge to pair with a battle, perhaps with ranged attackers on the other side of the bridge. 

### A Meal Fit for a Dragon

**Setup:** The PCs must successfully cook a succulent meal for a dragon in order to gain his assistance and avoid being eaten.

**Level:** 5.

**Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures. 

**Distance:** The bridge is 100 feet long.  

**Primary Skills:** Nature (moderate, DC 14), Perception (moderate, DC 14)

**Success:** The dragon is delighted with the quality of his meal, improving his attitude towards the PCs to helpful.

**Failure:** The dragon is disgusted and insulted by his meal, making him hostile and unwilling to help the PCs.

### Escape the Guard

**Setup:** The PCs have been accused of treason, and must flee the city before they are apprehended by the king’s guard.

**Level:** 5.

**Frequency:** Round-by-round. 

**Opposition:** There are two groups of five guards each – one from the South Tower and one from the West Tower. Use the stats for four gang members (“guard members”) and one gang leader (“guard leader”). The guards have speed 6 (for a total of 16 when using both actions to dash). 

The South Tower guards act on initiative 10, from round 1. 

The West Tower guards act on initiative 15, from round 6. 

**The Distance:** 

*Yonder Street (120 feet):* A long, narrow street (10 feet wide before the stalls on both sides, which are about 5 feet deep). Leads into the Twisting Bazaar. 

*The Twisting Bazaar:* The PCs wander into a bazaar whose colorful tents create a dizzying maze roughly 100 square feet in size. Only one character in the group needs to make a Streetsmarts check (moderate, DC 15) to escape to Fish Street. However, if the party is split up (they entered the bazaar on different rounds and didn't wait for one another) then each group must pass the check separately. 

*Fish Street (120 feet):* A long, narrow street (10 feet wide). Leads to freedom. 

**Interventions:**

*"Stop them!" (swift, once per street):* The guards are on one of the streets; the guards call for the immediate arrest of the PCs, and the PCs' frantic demeanor makes the city’s inhabitants suspicious of their actions and intentions. Each PC must make a Bluff check (easy, DC 10; moderate if the PC dashed last turn, DC 15) at the start of their turn or the entire street is difficult terrain for that turn. 

*"You've got the wrong guy!" (standard, once per street):* *Stop them!* is in effect for the street; Bluff (moderate, DC 15) or Intimidate (hard, DC 22). On a success, the crowd blames someone else. PCs ignore *Stop them!* for this street.

*"We're the people's heroes!" (standard, once per street):* Diplomacy (moderate, DC 15) or Bluff (hard, DC 22). On a success, the guards are subject to *Stop them!* for this street; the PCs are not. 

*"There you are!" (standard, at-will):* If the party is split into multiple groups in the bazaar: Streetsmarts (easy, DC 10). On a success, two groups in the bazaar find one another. 

*Climb the roofs (standard, at-will):* Athletics (moderate, DC 15). On a success, the character is on the roofs of the houses. It is the same distance to the end of the street, but not affected by *Stop them!* or other obstacles. Guards may climb onto the roofs to intercept the PCs depending on what is happening on the street. This only works on the two streets: the bazaar's roof is made up of soft fabric that will not bear weight. 

*"We'll cut our way through" (standard, at-will):* The fabric sides of the tents of the bazaar have AC 10 and 20 HP. Flip a coin each time a tent is cut through – on a heads, it is an outer tent and the PCs can escape to Fish Street. However, doing so alienates the residents of the Bazaar, and the DC of any further Streetsmarts checks in the bazaar increases by 5 once PCs start attacking the tents. 

*Hide or disguise (standard, at-will):* Group check, Bluff (easy, DC 10) or Stealth (moderate, DC 15). On a success, the guards lose the PCs. Three stay in the current location to search for them, the guard leader and one guard member head to the next location. 

*Into the sewers (standard, at-will):* Dungeoneering (hard, DC 22). On a success, the PCs enter the sewers. They escape the guards, but for all they know something worse lurks beneath the city ... 

**Thresholds:** At the start of the sixth round, the West Tower guards arrive in Fish Street and set up a blockade 60 feet into Fish Street. 

**Success:** The PCs manage to slip away from the king’s guards.

**Failure:** The PCs fail to escape the king’s guards. They must the guards or surrender, in which case they are brought back to the castle and tossed into the dungeon to await their fate.

### Race to the Tomb

**Setup:** The PCs must race a rival gang of treasure hunters to an ancient tomb so they can claim its treasures for themselves.

**Level:** 5.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every six hours.  

**Opposition:** A rival group of adventurers: one repeater crossbowman, one cowled assassin, one hulk and one shadowblast warlock. 

They act on initiative 15, and take two increments to complete each leg of the distance. 

**The Distance:** The PCs must decide whether to set out at night, or take six hours for a long rest and set out at sunrise. 

*The Winding Road (30 miles):* A dirt road through the canyons. The PCs can complete it in two increments by pushing on (Endure DC 20), or comfortably in three increments (including a long rest in between).  

*Mountainside:* The PCs must scale the side of a large mountain in order to reach the hidden tomb. Each character must succeed on one of the following checks to progress: Athletics (easy, DC 10), Nature (moderate, DC 15), Endure (moderate, DC 15), Acrobatics (moderate, DC 15). PCs that have succeeded can stay at the top to help others with the Aid Another action during the next increment. 

*Entrance:* The PCs have reached the entrance to the tomb. It is trapped with a phase spider venom needle trap. 

**Interventions:**

*Block the way (6 hours, once per stretch):* Athletics (moderate, DC 15). The rival group will take one additional increment to complete this leg, if they have not already completed it.   

**Thresholds:** 

After the 18th hour (after three six-hour increments have passed), a massive thunderstorm rolls into the valley where the tomb is hidden. All skill checks become hard (DC 22) for the next six hours (the fourth increment). 

**Success:** The PCs reach the tomb first, giving them the opportunity to raid its treasures before their rivals.

**Failure:** The PCs have reached the tomb too late, and will likely have to assault their foe’s base of operations in order to find the treasure they seek.

### Cracking the Spellbook

**Setup:** The PCs must search the library of a vanished wizard in order to learn of any wards that the spellcaster might have placed upon his spellbook before he disappeared. 

**Level:** 6.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check each hour.  

**Successes Required:** 5 before 3 failures. 

**Primary Skills:** Arcana (easy, DC 11), History (moderate, DC 16), Religion (moderate, DC 16)

PCs that track down the wizard's associates with Streetsmarts (easy, DC 11) could also use Diplomacy (moderate, DC 16). 

**Progress:** For each success, the players learn a piece of information: 

* The wizard’s spellbook is warded with a unique symbol spell of his own design. He wanted anyone brazen enough to try and learn from his works to suffer greatly for their arrogance.
* After several failed experiences left his book singed and his library badly burned, the wizard decided a more subtle approach was in order. He began devising a way to make sure that anyone who read from his book without his permission would be unable to read anything ever again.

* The wizard devised a nefarious spell gylph that, when activated, puts all affected to sleep. Those who fell asleep from the glyph’s influence also permanently lost the ability to read and write. Characters can now use Sleight of Hand (easy, DC 11) to progress the extended challenge by working to deactivate the symbol.

* The wizard designed a bypass mechanic for his spellbook’s trap so he wouldn’t need to be bothered with constantly disarming and rearming the trap. The glyph does not trigger for anyone who opens the spellbook while wearing a signet ring with the wizard’s insignia upon it.

**Success:** The PCs are able to bypass the spellbook’s wards and defenses, allowing them to glean arcane knowledge from it and catch a rare glimpse at the vanished wizard’s musings and experiments.

**Failure:** If the PCs achieved four successes, then they know they can bypass the spellbook's trap with the signet ring. Otherwise, they must either find a way to remove the wards or risk opening the book and facing the wrath of whatever spells he placed upon his most private of treasures.

If the book is opened, creatures in a 12-square burst are subject to the following attack: +11 vs Will; the target falls asleep (save ends). *Aftereffect:* The target is cursed to be unable to read or write (until the curse is broken). 

### An Audience with the King

**Setup:** The PCs must convince the king’s majordomo to admit them to the throne room.

**Level:** 7.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check each minute.  

**Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures. 

**Primary Skills:** Bluff (moderate, DC 16), Diplomacy (easy, DC 11), History (moderate, DC 16), Intimidate (moderate, DC 16), Insight (hard, DC 23). 

If a character fails on an Intimidate check, the difficulty of Diplomacy checks increases to moderate (DC 16). 

**Success:** If the PCs succeed, the majordomo permits them an audience with the king immediately, and the king’s starting attitude with the PCs is friendly.

**Failure:** The majordomo does not permit the PCs an audience with the king. 

### Staying the Course

**Setup:** The PCs must fight to keep their ship on-course during a deadly storm.

**Setting:** At the start of the extended challenge, the PCs can choose which of five locations they are at: the main mast, the quarterdeck, the bowsprit, the crow's nest and the main deck.

**Level:** 8.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check each minute. As well as their check, a PC can move from any other location to the main deck, or from the main deck to any other location (but not both).  

**Successes Required:** 3 (special) before 3 failures. 

One success at each of three locations: the main mast, the quarterdeck and the bowsprit. 

**Primary Skills:** Acrobatics (moderate, DC 17), Athletics (moderate, DC 17). 

**Success:** The PCs weather the storm and can continue sailing without impediment.

**Failure:** The PCs survive the storm, but their ship is battered.

**Side Check:** On their turn, a character in the crow's nest can make a Nature check (moderate, DC 17) to help navigate into calmer waters. This lowers the DC of Acrobatics and Athletics checks to easy (DC 12). 

**Thresholds:**

*At the start of the first minute,* wind speeds increase to moderate (20 mph) and it begins to rain. 

*At the start of the second minute,* the wind speeds increase to strong (30 mph and the rain picks up into a full thunderstorm. At the start of each of their turns, characters suffer an attack: +13 vs Reflex; the target falls prone. If the target is already prone, they are swept overboard and take 4d6 damage. 

Standing up from prone takes a minute, and a successful Acrobatics or Athletics check (DC 12).

A character that is overboard takes 4d6 damage at the end of each turn that they remain overboard.  

Climbing back from overboard takes a minute, and a successful Acrobatics or Athletics check (DC 17). A character on the main deck can forfeit their check to instead throw a rope overboard, which gives the character a +5 bonus on their check. A character who climbs back from overboard arrives at the main deck. 

*At the start of the third minute,* lightning crashes in the sky above the PCs’ vessel. Each minute, there is a 25% chance that a lightning bolt will strike the ship and do 10d6 electricity damage to it (this counts as one additional failure). 

### Living Maze

**Setup:** The PCs must navigate through a living maze that seeks to entrap them within its confines.

**Level:** 8.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes.  

**Successes Required:** Challenge crawl, 4 challenges: 

*Living maze:* The maze that the PCs are traversing is alive, and must be outwitted at every turn. After one character succeeds on a Nature check (moderate, DC 17) or Perception check (hard, DC 24), move on to the next challenge. 

*Hole in reality:* The maze rips an interdimensional hole in itself to whisk the PCs back to the beginning of the maze. If the PCs fail a group Arcana check (moderate, DC 17), then make an attack against all characters: +13 vs Will; the target is teleported back to the beginning of the maze. 

This only occurs once, even if some characters are teleported back to the start. 

*The guardians:* The maze creates stone guardians to attempt to stop the PCs from advancing any further. Four sand sentries, but without the burrow movement. The sand sentries attack to knock the PCs unconscious, and once they do so each sand sentry prioritizes dragging one unconscious PC back to the start of the maze over fighting other PCs who are still conscious (but if attacked while dragging, will turn their attention to the attacker). 

*Stonewalled:* The maze seals its exit with a massive stone wall. Each character must succeed on an Athletics check (easy, DC 12) to climb the wall. Characters that have already passed can help those left behind with a hand or by throwing down a rope (Aid Another). The wall has resistance 20 to all damage and 100 hit points. 

### Would-Be Wedding

**Setup:** After Kyr’shin narrowly bested Gea, a would-be suitor, in single combat, both their kingdoms are hosting lavish celebrations in anticipation of Kyr’shin and Gea’s
betrothal. At the end of the party, the two are expected to announce whether or not they will be married, and the conditions of the marriage. The union of Kyr'shin and Gea's kingdoms would unite the kingdoms against the greater threat from the north.  

**Level:** 10.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes.  

**Protagonists:** 

*Kyr'shin* 

*Setup:* Kyr'shin must be convinced to marry Gea. 

*Successes Required:* 3 successes before 3 failures. 

*Primary Skills:* Athletics (moderate, DC 19), Bluff (moderate, DC 19), Diplomacy (hard, DC 26), History (moderate, DC 19)

Kyr'shin is stand-offish, but with an Insight check (DC 13) the PCs realize he is – despite being a brave warrior – extremely shy in social situations. This insight lowers the Diplomacy DC to easy (DC 13). The Insight success does not count towards total successes. 

*Success:* Kyr'shin agrees to marry Gea. 

*Failure:* Kyr'shin refuses to marry Gea. 



*Inquisitor Sala’dean* 

*Setup:* The Inquisitor is trying to root out a rumored assassination plot against Kyr'shin, not that he tells that to every person he meets at the party. 

*Successes Required:* 3 successes before 3 failures. 

*Primary Skills:* Bluff (moderate, DC 19), Diplomacy (moderate, DC 19), Insight (moderate, DC 19), Intimidate (moderate, DC 19), Streetsmarts (hard, DC 26)

* After the first success, the PCs confirm there is an assassination plot and the inquisitor will take them into his confidence. 
* After the second success, the details of the plot become clear: the assassins will wear the uniforms of Gea's kingdom when they carry out the attack as a false flag operation to sow discord.  

*Success:* The PCs discover the room where the assassins are hiding out in preparation. Fighting (and hopefully defeating) the assassins takes one interval for all PCs that participate. 

*Failure:* The Inquisitor decides he cannot trust the PCs, and excludes them from the hunt. 



*Dyne*

*Setup:* Dyne is a reclusive academic and an expert on a field of study of current relevance to the PCs. The wedding is their one opportunity to find out more from him. 

*Successes Required:* 3 successes before 3 failures. 

*Primary Skills:* Arcana (moderate, DC 19), Nature (moderate, DC 19), Religion (moderate, DC 19)

Dyne is clearly favoring one leg – he fell from his horse on his way to the wedding but was too proud to ask the hosts for help. If a PC treats his injury (Heal DC 13), the DC for all primary skills falls to easy (DC 13). The Heal success does not count towards total successes. 

*Success:* Dyne agrees to help the PCs with their inquiries. 

*Failure:* The PCs burn their bridges with Dyne. 

**Thresholds:** Unless the PCs (or at least some of the PCs) intercept and defeat the assassins before one hour (the end of the 6th interval), they burst into the main chamber. They try to kill Kyr'shin. Even if the assassins are defeated, the wedding is over and the PCs fail with any players that they had not already achieved 3 successes with. 

The assassins consist of one insidious assassin and one martial artist. 

### Crushing Ceiling

**Setup:** The PCs must discover a way to escape the chamber before they are crushed by the room’s slowly descending ceiling.

**Setting:** A 20-foot by 20-foot sealed chamber with a 50-foot high ceiling. The walls, floor, and ceiling are 20-foot by 20-foot slabs of stone (hardness 8, 1,800 hp), and when the extended challenge begins the ceiling-slab begins descending towards the ground at a rate of 5 feet per round. The ceiling slab weighs 1.5 tons (3,000 pounds).

**Level:** 10.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check as a standard action.  

**Successes Required:** 5 successes before 10 rounds elapse. 

**Primary Skills:** Perception (moderate, DC 19), Sleight of Hand (moderate, DC 19)

**Success:** If the PCs succeed before the time pressure concludes, they find a secret door that enables them to escape the room.

**Failure:** If the PCs fail to gain 5 successes before the time pressure ends, the slab attacks all creatures in the room at the end of each round. +15 vs Fortitude; the target is grappled. If the target is already grappled, it takes 10d6+8 damage. Creatures that are not grappled can continue to make skill checks to attempt to find the hidden door, accruing successes towards escaping the room.

**Special:** This is a good challenge to pair with a battle, perhaps with oozes that can squeeze between gaps and are indifferent to the ceiling. 

### Prosecution

**Setup:** The PCs must take on the role of prosecutors in a trial in order to prevent an enemy from acquitting herself. 

**Level:** 11.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes.  

**Successes Required:** 3 successes before 3 failures. 

**Primary Skills:** Up to two characters can participate in the trial itself as advocates: Bluff (moderate, DC 19), Diplomacy (moderate, DC 19), Insight (hard, DC 26)

If a character fails on a Bluff check, the DC of a Diplomacy check increases to hard (DC 26). If a character succeeds on an Insight check, the DC of Diplomacy and Bluff checks decreases to easy (DC 13).

Other characters can attempt the following one-off measures:

*Frighten or bribe the enemy's henchman into telling the truth* (Intimidate, DC 19, or pay 1,000 gold pieces).

*Find incriminating evidence among the opposing counsel's notes* (Perception, DC 26, or Streetsmarts, DC 19). On a success, also remove one failure. 

*Uncover last-minute evidence* (History, DC 19). On a success, can also swap out one of the PCs participating in the trial itself as an advocate. 

**Success:** If the PCs succeed, their enemy is jailed and receives the maximum possible sentence, as appropriate for her crimes.

**Failure:** If the PCs fail, their enemy is left off with minimal sentencing, as they were unable to produce sound enough evidence to incarcerate her. If the PCs failed with no successes, the townsfolk become quickly convinced that they are the true perpetrators of their enemy's crimes and seek to either imprison them or run them out of town. 

### History Lesson at the War College

**Setup:** The PCs must discover the hidden history of the war college if they are to properly defend it against a hobgoblin invasion. 

**Level:** 12.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every day.  

**Successes Required:** 5 successes before 3 failures, and before 5 days elapse. 

**Primary Skills:** History (easy, DC 14), Insight (moderate, DC 20), Sleight of Hand (moderate, DC 20), Streetsmarts (moderate, DC 20) 

**Success:** The PCs are able to discover and address the weakest parts of the college’s defenses.

**Failure:** The college’s defenses are woefully inadequate for the war to come.

**Progression:** Each success imparts a piece of information: 

* The brewmaster at the Fox and Swan believes that red hair is a blessing from the god of war, and frequently offers discounts on masterwork and enchanted weapons to ginger-headed warriors.

* When a local duke was slain in battle, his legendary shield Stalwart was never recovered. It is believed that the hobgoblins’ war chief took it as a trophy.
  
* Detailed blueprints illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the war college. All border forts on the northern frontier were built with similar defenses.

* Scouting reports mention a shield matching Stalwart’s description in the hands of a hobgoblin warlord gathering an army in the nearby hills. It is rumored
  that this new war chief is either the descendant of the shield’s previous hobgoblin master or that she defeated the aging warlord in battle.

* A secret postern gate in the southeast wall of the war college provides access to the guard barracks. The college fell to the goblin army during the last war, and there is evidence that the hobgoblins might attempt the same trick again in the near future.

### Against the Avalanche

**Setup:** The PCs must push their way up to a mountain shrine while an avalanche cascades around them – at the behest of the shrine's guardian, a kami.

**Level:** 13.

**Frequency:** Each hero can make one check every 10 minutes. 

**Successes Required:** Challenge crawl, 4 challenges: 

*Characters must scale the mountain.* Each character must succeed on one of the following checks to progress: Athletics (easy, DC 14), Acrobatics (moderate, DC 21), Endure (moderate, DC 21), Nature (moderate, DC 21).

*Plant life:* The jingushigami uses its ability to control plants to temporarily command a number of plant creatures in the area to impede the PCs. After one character succeeds on a Nature check (moderate, DC 21), all characters can progress. Otherwise, characters progress after waiting 10 minutes.  

*Manipulate terrain:* Frustrated by their advances, the jinushigami uses its *manipulate terrain* power to make the mountain more difficult to traverse. Each character must succeed on one of the following checks to progress: Acrobatics (moderate, DC 21), Athletics (easy, DC 14), Endure (moderate, DC 21), Nature (moderate, DC 21).

*The kami:* Mere feet away from the shrine, the jinushigami emerges to confront the PCs. At this stage, checks take 1 minute – which means this challenge is likely to be resolved in a single 10-minute cycle. The jinushigami begins as unfriendly. 3 successes before 3 failures. On a failure, or if the PCs initiate, the jinushigami attacks. On a success, or when the jinushigami is defeated, all other skill DCs in the challenge crawl drop to easy (DC 14). 

Primary Skills:  Bluff (moderate, DC 21), Diplomacy (easy, DC 14) or Intimidate (hard, DC 28). 

Secondary Skills: History, Nature, Religion. These can be used with aid another to give a bonus to the primary skills. 

**Events:** 

*After the first failure in the crawl,* the jingushigami that has made the mountain its ward triggers an avalanche. Characters that have already succeeded on a check are in the “slide zone”, and suffer an attack: +18 vs Reflex; 4d6 damage, and the target is buried. 

Characters that have not yet succeeded on a check are in the “bury” zone, and suffer an attack: +18 vs Reflex; on a hit, 8d6 damage, and the target is buried. On a miss, 4d6 damage, and the target is buried.  

Characters who are buried must use their check to dig themselves out with an Athletics check (easy, DC 14). Characters who aren’t buried can use their check to dig out one ally, or two if they have an appropriate tool, such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel. 

*After the first success in the “manipulate terrain” challenge,* the jinushigami, enraged, uses its *earthquake* power to attempt to halt the PCs’ progress. Each character is attacked, regardless of their progress: +18 vs Reflex; the target cannot make a check on their next turn. 

### The Omeli Portal  

*A series of old, rusty contraptions decorate the Omeli manor home’s tallest tower, with no evidence of their use of function. However, if one should find Sir Omeli’s old notebooks detailing their use, and if that one should activate the machine during a storm, that one might just find themselves facing what Sir Omeli spent his whole life trying to find: the gateway to Heaven.*  

This incantation is found in Sir Omeli’s notes, and details the workings of the machine in the highest tower of his manor. This machine harnesses power from lightning and, with the aid of a focusing diamond, opens a portal to the Outer Plane of Heaven.  

**Setup:** The PCs are examining the machine in the Omeli manor during an electrical storm.   

**Level:** 15.  

**Check Successes Required:** 6 before 3 failures.  

**Primary Skills:** 

*Sleight of Hand (DC 15):* Your talent at working with traps and other devices allows you to delicately adjust the machinery.   

*Nature (DC 22):* You have a good weather-eye, and you can time the contraption's use to exactly when lightning strikes the manor.   

*History (DC 30):* You remember an obscure detail of Sir Omeli's life, which gives you a clue about how the contraption is meant to operate.   

*Religion (DC 30):* Your knowledge of planar convergences gives you insight into how to set the mechanism.

*Perception (DC 22):* You find the focusing diamond. If the focusing diamond cannot be found, another gem can be used as a substitute but it is destroyed in the process.   

**Special:** An encounter or daily power with the Lightning tag can provide assistance at the nick of time. Once during the challenge, one of these powers can be used to cancel out a failure (it does not turn into a success, however).   

**Success:** The PCs travel to Heaven, appearing at an unpredictable place on the plane.  

While this machine can be used to travel to Heaven, alternate means (or an assistant to open the portal again from the Material Plane side) must be employed to return.  

**Failure:** The machine backfires, flooding the area with radiant energy. All creatures within 100 squares of the machine take 5d10 radiant damage and are blinded for 24 hours.   

### Wake the Forest Watcher  

*Around the forest they tell a local legend, where a girl lost in the forest at night sang and danced to keep away fear. The forest watcher, entranced by her voice and movements, came and showed her the way out. To this day, children who grow up near the forest learn this story and its accompanying song and dance. Outsiders think it a quaint tradition, but the local children know if they are ever lost in the forest, the Forest Watcher may be their only salvation.*  

Use this extended challenge to reflect player characters calling on the mysterious spirit known as the Forest Watcher for assistance.   

**Setup:** The PCs are within the bounds of the forest during night.   

The Forest Watcher may be entreated for directions to anything within or on the edge of the forest, always revealing the shortest path. The Forest Watcher may also be asked questions about what is currently within the forest, although it cannot reveal more than what an observer could discover.  

**Level:** Equal to the average level of the PCs – the Forest Watcher expects better performances from those able to give them.  

**Check Successes Required:** 3 before 3 failures.  

**Primary Skills:** Acrobatics, Diplomacy, Nature.  

*Acrobatics (moderate DCs):* You dance elegantly and expertly, impressing the Forest Watcher.  

*Diplomacy (moderate DCs):* You phrase your request to the Forest Watcher in a polite and humble manner.   

*Nature (easy DCs):* You recognize the best part of the forest to make your entreaty from, to be most easily heard by the Forest Watcher.   

**Failure:** All participants are exhausted, losing a recovery. A particularly poor effort may anger the Forest Watcher, leading it to direct creatures of the forest against the PCs.   

# Bonds  

Over time, player characters will ingratiate themselves with and derive power from different patrons, powerful magical artifacts, secret societies, and so on. These relationships are often ephemeral, lasting over two or three adventures. In some cases they last longer, particularly if the player character is prepared to keep investing in them.   

When a character forms one of these bonds, they start with a Favor of 5, which corresponds to a “Neutral” attitude.   

##### Table – Favor and Attitude

| Favor     | Attitude   |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 0 or less | Hostile    |
| 1-4       | Unfriendly |
| 5-11      | Neutral    |
| 12-15     | Friendly   |
| 16-20     | Helpful    |

If the player character serves the bond, it strengthens and Favor increases. If they defy the bond or neglect it, Favor decreases.   

Some example bonds are shown below.   

## Ancient Priesthood  

Prestige-tier bond  

The player character joins a secretive priesthood with its own language. Red in tooth and claw but with a soft spot for mistletoe, these priests worship ancient gods.   

### Favor

Example ways a character may gain or lose Ancient Priesthood Favor:

**Learn Incantation:** Upon joining the ancient priesthood, you are taught an incantation. You do not get to choose the incantation. Those with a Friendly bond are taught a second, and Helpful a third. You still need the Incantation Caster feat in order to cast the incantation. 

### Hostile  

**Spiritual Duties:** You must make a blood sacrifice alongside every incantation you perform or the incantation does not work.   

**Obsessed with the Unnatural:** You suffer a -2 penalty on any attack that does not include a creature with the undead or construct tags or the cosmic source.  

### Unfriendly  

**Spiritual Duties**

## Knighthood  

Adventurer-tier bond  

The player character is knighted, giving them a feudal lord to whom they owe loyalty as well as retainers who owe them loyalty. They belong to the nobility while they retain their rank and title.

### Hostile  

**Powerful Enemies:** Once every month or so, you face an attack, sabotage or arson from one of your enemies. This might take the form of an encounter of your level, or an extended challenge as you try to undo the damage they have done.   

**Render Unto Caesar:** Your liege lord demands 1,000 gp a month in additional tithes – or for you to go on a quest of your lord's choosing every six months.

### Moving On  

While a player character may well remain a knight for the rest of their life, they may still give up this bond by travelling far away from their lands, by rising to a higher rank with different duties, by leaving their domain in the care of a spouse or regent, and so on. 

Alternatively, they may actually be stripped of their knighthood – perhaps they lied about their pedigree, they were falsely (or fairly) accused of unchivalrous behaviour or there has been a revolution.   

## Revenant

Heroic-tier bond

When you are killed, your Game Master may give you the opportunity to  return as a revenant. You begin with Favor 5. Over time, you can shake  off your revenant nature and return to life fully – or succumb to  hunger and misery and become a revenant for good.

## Tyrfing  

Prestige-tier bond  

The player character receives the great and terrible sword Tyrfing, which demands to kill each time it is drawn.   

### Favor

Example ways a character may gain or lose Tyrfing Favor:

**Mysterious Whispers:** Once per day, Tyrfing whispers a name to you. You have already or will soon meet this person. You suffer a -2 penalty on any attack that does not include them as a target. If you take a long rest without having killed them, the penalty ends but you start the next day with one fewer recovery.   

**Obsessive:** You suffer a -2 penalty on any skill check that takes more than one round.   

### Unfriendly

If a creature could deliver a killing blow to the player character but shows them mercy instead, the player character can cast aside Tyrfing of their own free will.    

# Traps  

Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  

## How to Use Traps

Traps can often spice up a combat encounter. Outside of combat, the party does not face the same time and healing pressures, which means traps can feel a little flat. They can still be used to good effect to heighten tension, consume the party's resources or reward clever thinking by the party. 

The traps are usually generic in describing their trigger, but the following are all good options for a trap that targets the creature that triggered it:

* When a chest or drawer is opened.
* When a door is opened. 
* When a character enters a square, stepping on a pressure plate. 
* When a character crosses a trip wire stretched across several squares. Characters that have noticed a trip wire can usually step over it and avoid triggering the trap. 
* When a character interacts with a corpse, precious item or other interesting object, yanking a trip wire attached to the object.  
* When the wrong answer is inputted to a puzzle, like mosaic tiles that must be pressed in a special sequence. 

Something like a lever or button could be used to activate traps that target an area, rather than the creature that triggered them. 

If you select the same trap multiple times for an encounter, it could reflect multiple charges of the one trap or multiple instances of the trap scattered throughout the battlefield. 

## Traps in Play  

When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.  

### Triggering a Trap  

Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the *glyph of warding* spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.  

### Detecting and Disabling a Trap  

Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap's presence.  

A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to notice it or disable it. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Perception check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Perception score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to pause or disarm it.   

### Adjudicating Traps

In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.  

You should allow a character to discover a trap without making a skill check if something would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.  

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.  

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.  

## Trap Types

There are several varieties of type:

* **One-Off:** These traps trigger once, and must be reset before they will trigger again (or in some cases cannot be reset at all). It would be rare, though not impossible, for a one-off trap to be reset during combat. These traps are usually worth one-quarter the XP of a standard trap of their level. 
* **Hazard:** These traps remain on the battlefield, affecting any creature that comes into contact with them. These traps are usually worth one-half the XP of a standard trap of their level. 
* **Recurring:** These traps activate or at least can be activated once per round, once they are triggered. 

## Trap Roles

* **Shooter:** Multiple attacks or areas of effect.   
* **Assassin:** The trap alternates between triggering and retracting.   
* **Blocker:** The trap serves as an impediment, or punishes movement through a particular area.   
* **Alarm:** The trap makes a ruckus or otherwise alerts other enemies. Typically it also has negative effects to those who trigger it.   

## Traps in Encounters

# Afflictions

Afflictions are long term, negative effects that characters can suffer from. A creature experiences the negative effects of the stage of the affliction that they are at, plus all earlier stages of the affliction. A creature that reaches stage 0 of its affliction is cured, and loses the affliction. 

## Transmission

Afflictions like poisons and diseases are usually transmitted in one of the four following ways. Afflictions like curses can, of course, be transmitted in all sorts of other ways. 

### Contact

Merely touching this type of affliction exposes the creature. 

### Ingested

Ingested afflictions are virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something poisoned. A chest or other object can be smeared with contact poison as part of a trap. 

### Inhaled

Inhaled afflictions do not affect those that do not breathe. However, holding one’s breath is ineffective against most inhaled afflictions; they  affect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body as well as the lungs.

### Injury

This affliction must be delivered through a wound. Traps that cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like  sometimes contain injury poisons.

A contact or injury poison applied to a weapon is transmitted to the target the next time an attack with that weapon hits, provided there is such a hit within 5 minutes of application. 

### Curse of Lycanthropy (Curse)  

*Level X (this disease is of the same level as the creature that inflicted it).*  

Lycanthropes are humanoids who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other members of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to have or acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.  

Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease, typically from the bites of lycanthropes.    

**Infection:** One day after a humanoid creature is bitten by a lycanthrope, the creature must succeed on a saving throw or become infected. The creature begins on stage 1.

**Progression:** It takes until the next full moon for lycanthropy's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include heavy hair growth, irritability and a taste for raw meat.  

Each time there is a full moon, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 14 + the level of the disease). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.  

* *Stage 1:* If the infected creature is adjacent to an enemy, the creature cannot willingly move away from that enemy.   
* *Stage 2:* If the infected creature is adjacent to an enemy, the creature cannot willingly move away from that enemy. The infected creature cannot use powers that target allies.   
* *Stage 3:* The infected creature becomes a lycanthrope. They can use the *hybrid shape* power. When under the light of the full moon, they must use *hybrid shape*, and can do so even if it is expended. 

### Sewer Plague (Disease)  

*Level 3*  

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.  

**Infection:** Five minutes after a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a saving throw or become infected. The creature begins at stage 1.

**Progression:** It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The creature begins on stage 1.   

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 16). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.  

* *Stage 1:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries.  
* *Stage 2:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries, cannot heal above its Staggered threshold.   
* *Stage 3:* The infected creature does not recover spent recoveries and cannot heal by any means.   

### Shadowstuff Toxin (Poison)  

*Level 7*   

**Infection:** A creature that makes contact with or is hit with a weapon coated with shadowstuff toxin is subject to a +10 attack vs Fortitude. If hit, they are afflicted. The creature begins on stage 1.

**Progression:** Each hour the target must make a saving throw.  If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they succeed, they make no further saving throws but stay at their current stage until an antidote is administered.  

* *Stage 1:* Victim's skin and eyes turn grey.  

* *Stage 2:* Shadows cling to the victim; +2 to Stealth.  

* *Stage 3:* Victim can no longer be healed beyond staggered.   

* *Stage 4:* Victim begins to flicker from existence; +2 bonus to AC.   

* *Stage 5:* The character ceases to exist and can only be returned to life by powerful magic.   

**Cost:** 104 gp per dose  

### Cackle Fever (Disease)  

*Level 12*  

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of hysterical laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”  

**Infection:** Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 2 squares of an infected creature in the throes of hysterical laughter (see stage 2) suffers a +16 attack vs Fortitude. On a hit, it is infected with the disease. On a miss, it is immune to the hysterical laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.  

**Progression:** Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature loses one recovery that cannot be restored until the disease is cured. The creature begins on stage 1.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 25). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.   

* *Stage 1:* The creature is prone to giggling and finds it hard to concentrate (-2 penalty on all Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma skill checks).
* *Stage 2:* Any event that causes the infected creature great stress – including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare – forces the creature to make a saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d10 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with hysterical laughter (save ends).   
* *Stage 3:* As stage 2, but the infected creature no longer makes Endure checks that might improve the affliction.  

### Sight Rot (Disease)  

*Level 9*  

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.  

**Infection:** One day after a beast or humanoid drinks water tainted by sight rot, they suffer a +12 attack vs Fortitude. On a hit, they are infected with the disease (beginning on stage 1). 

**Progression:** The creature's vision starts to become blurry.   

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make an Endure check (DC 22). If they fail, they get one stage worse. If they beat the DC by 5 or more, they get one stage better. Otherwise, they remain at the same stage. If the infected creature reaches stage 3, they remain at that stage until specially treated.   

* *Stage 1:* The creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks.  
* *Stage 2:* The creature suffers a -4 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks.   
* *Stage 3:* The creature is blinded until treated.  

**Treatment:** Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character trained in Nature can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.  

# Terrain

## Pools of Chaos

*Level 3*

Pools of chaos are composed of raw, seething primal chaos. Proximity to a pool of chaos may bring about strange changes over time, while direct contact with the raw chaos is even quicker. 

**Changes to inanimate matter:** While immediate contact with a pit of chaos is instantly transformative, even near proximity to a pit will slowly transform objects and creatures. Objects (or portions of objects) within 20 squares of a pit of chaos have a chance of alteration as follows:

* 50 percent chance on contact, and each round after
* 10 percent chance after the first hour
* 5 percent chance after the first 24 hours
* 5 percent chance after the first month
* 5 percent chance after the first year
* 5 percent chance each year thereafter

These percentage chances are not cumulative.

When something is changed, half the time its material changes and the other half of the time its shape or texture changes. Use the Material Changes and Shape/Texture Changes tables to determine the specific type of change.

Generally these alterations cannot be reversed or repaired except through the use of an art.

* On contact, and each round after

*After spending time within 20 squares of a pit of chaos:*

* After the first hour
* After the first 24 hours

**Spellcasting near a pool of chaos:** Using incantations or arcane powers within 20 squares of a pit of chaos is a risky proposition. To successfully cast the spell the caster must attempt an Arcana check (DC 10 plus half the level of the power or incantation). If this check fails, roll on the Spellcasting Changes table to determine how the spell’s effect is changed. Some results have multiple entries – choose the first one which applies.

##### Table – Spellcasting Changes

| d%    | Change to the Spell Effect                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-20 | Spell target(s) or those within the area of effect are affected as if they made contact with a pool of chaos. |
| 21-50 | Near and Far spells have a random area within range (and random targets within that area where relevant). Melee and ranged spells choose targets randomly from those within range. Spells with a range of self instead target a random creature within 6 squares. |
| 51-70 | Damage-inflicting spells heal instead of harm. Penalties become bonuses and vice versa. Effects become their opposites, if applicable. |
| 71-85 | Spell energy goes wild, becoming a random spell of the same level, keeping target the same if possible. |
| 86-00 | Spell energy surges uncontrollably, exploding in a Near burst 10. +7 attack vs Reflex; on a hit, 1d12+3 force damage. |

# Vehicles

Airships, wagons and ships are all vehicles. 

Once a vehicle is in motion, it needs attention. If the driver fails to use a Drive, Turn or Brake action on their turn, the vehicle careens (with special rules for each vehicle). 

**Driver:** Regardless of the number of occupants, only one person can drive a vehicle. The vehicle operates only on that character's turn. Even if careening, the vehicle only slides or stops on the driver's turn. 

**Speed:** The speed given for a vehicle is the number of squares it can move if its driver takes the Drive action. A vehicle can move up to double its speed in one round, for example if its driver takes the Drive action twice.  

**Careening:** If a vehicle moved in the last round, then its driver must either use the Accelerate, Turn or Brake action on it this round, or at the end of its driver's turn the vehicle is careening. See each vehicle's description for what happens. Characters in a careening vehicle are dazed. Once a vehicle stops moving, it is no longer careening. 

References to the vehicle's driver's place in the initiative count refer to the vehicle's most recent driver. Even if the driver is incapacitated, dead or has abandoned the vehicle, use what the (former) driver's initiative count was.

**Escape:** As an immediate (counter) action when a vehicle begins to careen, or a move action at any time, a character can attempt to escape a vehicle. The character must make a DC 15 Acrobatics check (+5 if the creature is strapped in; DC 20 for the driver). A driver who attempts to escape no longer has any control over the vehicle. Any target failing the escape roll by 5 or less still escapes but takes damage as if it were a crash at the vehicle's current speed (see below).

**Total Move Entitlement:** A vehicle's total move entitlement is the maximum distance it could have moved this turn, even if its driver moved it less than that or it crashed before it made it that far. For example, if a speed 6 vehicle has had the Drive action taken twice, its movement for the round is 12. 

**Crash:** If a vehicle moves (either deliberately or because it is careening) into an obstruction or difficult terrain it cannot cross, it stops immediately. The vehicle and all occupants inside take damage according to the vehicle's total movement entitlement for the round. 

##### Table – Crash Damage

| **Movement** | **Damage** |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Less than 5  | No damage  |
| 5-6          | 1d8        |
| 7-9          | 2d8        |
| 10-13        | 3d8        |
| 14-18        | 4d8        |
| 19-24        | 5d8        |
| 25-31        | 6d8        |
| 32-39        | 7d8        |
| 40-48        | 8d8        |
| 49-58        | 9d8        |
| 59-69        | 10d8       |

**Vehicle Size:** Certain (ground) vehicles are large enough to withstand difficult terrain and/or the effects of a crash. Depending on the topography (marsh or debris, for example), Gargantuan or larger vehicles can ignore difficult terrain for the purposes of movement penalties and crashing. The severity of the terrain may impede even these vehicles. Most vehicles Huge or smaller cannot enter squares labeled as difficult terrain. Depending on the situation, they may get stuck or hit an obstruction. Both situations are considered a crash.

A vehicle cannot squeeze or adjust its occupying squares. It also cannot go prone. 

**Character Actions:** Most character actions don't apply to the vehicles they control or ride inside. Certain other actions are limited while inside or on a vehicle.

*Flanking:* Vehicles cannot flank, though occupants can.

*Movement:* Creatures inside a vehicle can move freely inside of it. Disembarking is a move action: the creature moves to any square adjacent to the vehicle. This is not a shift and provokes an opportunity attack.

Movement made as part of a power can be used to disembark a vehicle. 

*Using Skills:* Any skill that could be negatively impacted by the motion of a vehicle (such as Heal or Sleight of Hand) suffers a penalty of -2 to -6, at the GM's discretion.

*Reach:* Creatures inside/on a vehicle have reach 1 beyond the vehicle.

**Destroying Vehicles:** Reducing a vehicle to zero hit points renders it non-functional. A vehicle reduced to its negative hit point value may burst into flame, immediately inflicting 3d6 damage to every creature that moves through or enters a square the vehicle occupied or adjacent to it until the end of the encounter.

**Capacity:** The standard person capacity or crew. In most cases, only one person is needed to operate the vehicle (the “driver”); other crewmembers serve as gunners or co-pilots. Each unused passenger slot allows the vehicle to carry an additional 100 pounds of cargo.

**Cargo Capacity:** The amount of cargo the vehicle is designed to carry in pounds. You cannot replace cargo for people comfortably.

**Hardness:** The vehicle’s resistance to all damage.

## New Actions

### Drive (move action)

The vehicle you are driving moves a number of squares in the direction it is facing, up to its speed. 

### Turn (move action)

The vehicle you are driving moves a number of squares in the direction it is facing, up to half its speed. At some point during its move, rotate it 45 or 90 degrees. It can then move straight ahead in the new direction it is facing if it has movement remaining. 

### Brake (move action)

The vehicle you are driving moves a number of squares in the direction it is facing, up to its speed. 

### Take Control (move action)

You become the driver of a vehicle you are riding in, provided the vehicle does not currently have a driver.

### Ram (standard action)

The vehicle you are driving moves a number of squares in the direction it is facing, up to its speed. If it ends its movement adjacent to a creature, vehicle or object no more than one size larger than your vehicle, the ram occurs. 

**Attack:** Dexterity or Intelligence vs. the target's Fortitude defense.

*Hit:* The effect of the ram is determined by the size of the target.

*One Size Larger:* All occupants of your vehicle are dazed until the start of your next turn. Your vehicle and the target take damage according to your total move entitlement. The damage die for your vehicle is d8; for the target it is d4. You push the target 1 square and shift into the vacated square. Your vehicle comes to a stop. 

*Same Size:* All occupants of your vehicle and the target (or occupants of the target vehicle) are dazed until the start of your next turn. Your vehicle and the target take damage according to your total move entitlement. The damage die for both your vehicle and the target is d6. You push the target a number of squares equal to 1/4 your remaining (not current) speed and follow it, then come to a stop. 

*One Size Smaller:* The target (or occupants of the target vehicle) is dazed until the start of your next turn. Your vehicle and the target take damage according to your current speed. The damage die for your vehicle is d4; for the target it is d8. You push the target a number of squares equal to 1/2 your remaining (not current) speed, then come to a stop.

*Two or More Sizes Smaller:* The target (or occupants of the target vehicle) is stunned until the start of your next turn. Your vehicle and the target take damage according to your current speed. The damage die for the target is d10; your vehicle takes only 1 damage per die. You push the target a number of squares equal to your remaining (not current) speed -1 and follow it, then come to a stop. 

##### Table – Ramming Speed and Damage

| **Speed**   | **Damage** |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Less than 5 | No damage  |
| 5-6         | 1 die      |
| 7-9         | 2 dice     |
| 10-13       | 3 dice     |
| 14-18       | 4 dice     |
| 19-24       | 5 dice     |
| 25-31       | 6 dice     |
| 32-39       | 7 dice     |
| 40-48       | 8 dice     |
| 49-58       | 9 dice     |
| 59-69       | 10 dice    |

*Miss:* The target avoids you, and you continue moving your remaining speed.

**Colliding:** If the target moved in your direction in the last round, add the distance moved to your total movement entitlement before calculating damage.

**Impossible Push:** If the target is not pushed or cannot be pushed, you crash instead.  The target takes damage as indicated above: resolve the effects of the crash on your vehicle as normal.

### Scrape Vehicles 



**At-Will \* Martial, Vehicle**

**Standard Action**      **Close** burst 1

**Target:** One enemy vehicle

**Attack:** Dexterity vs. Reflex

**Hit:** Damage is 1d6 + Dexterity modifier damage + your vehicle’s hardness. If the target vehicle is staggered by this hit, its driver must make a check (DC 15; skill depends on the vehicle's Driver Skill). 

*Level 11:* The DC is 20. 

*Level 21:* The DC is 30. Damage is 2d6 + Dexterity modifier damage + your vehicle's hardness.
