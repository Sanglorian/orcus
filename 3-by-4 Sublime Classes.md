## +X forward

+x forward means you can add +x to any attack roll, defense score against a single attack, skill check or saving throw you make. You must say you are using it before you make the roll; that particular +x forward is then used up. +x forward is a power bonus, it does not stack with other power bonuses. 

If a creature has -x forward, then their opponents decide when to add it to any attack roll, defense score against a single attack, skill check or saving throw the creature makes. They must say they are using it before the creature makes the roll. Just like +x forward, -x forward does not stack. You must choose one only of those available to apply (or none). 

A +x or -x forward lasts until used or until the end of the encounter, whichever is sooner. 

## Expertise Dice

This resource presents sublime classes. Sublime classes have Expertise Dice, shortened to ED. 

A sublime character's class and level determine how many ED they begin combat with (if any). At the end of each turn, sublime characters often gain additional ED. 

When a character with ED makes a basic attack, they can spend a number of ED for bonus damage. Roll additional weapon damage dice equal to the ED spent. Characters can also spend ED for other purposes, depending on the stance that they are currently in.  ED a character spends for this purpose do not count towards bonus damage.

Characters must declare how many ED they are spending, and on what, before rolling their attack roll to see if they hit.  In total, a character cannot spend more ED on an attack than the maximum specified by their class and level. 

Any attack a character spends ED on gains the keyword associated with its sublime stance(s) (usually Martial).
