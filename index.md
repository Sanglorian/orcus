## How to contribute

Here's some of the things that would help Orcus grow: 

* A way to generate Markdown or HTML from the Excel spreadsheets where most of the game information is held. Currently I use Mail Merge in Word, which is actually not too bad except that it truncates any entry over 256 characters, which I then have to manually paste in afterwards.
* With a better way of outputting the material, there could also be better stylesheets for the Markdown/HTML - including columns, page numbers, better handling of images as priorities.
* People contributing homebrew material - either stuff they've already written for other games or stuff that they write especially for Orcus.
* Experienced players going through monsters, powers, etc., and tweaking the balance, even removing and replacing underwhelming powers.
* An En5ider-style ongoing crowdfunding campaign, creating new material every month that would get added back in to the Orcus database.
* An Orcus character generator, perhaps using PCGen.
* An Orcus online reference database.
