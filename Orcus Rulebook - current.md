# The Core Mechanic  

Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20). To determine if your character succeeds at a task you do this:  

- Roll a d20.  
- Add any relevant modifiers.  
- Compare the result to a target number.  
  

If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.  

## Dice  

Dice rolls are described with expressions such as “3d4+3,” which means “roll three four-sided dice and add 3” (resulting in a number between 6 and 15). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the “d” tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.  

### d%  

Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.  

## Modifiers  

A modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll. A positive modifier is a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty.  

### Stacking  

Modifiers to a given check or roll stack (combine for a cumulative effect) if they have different types (or no type at all), but do **not** stack if they have the same type. If the modifiers to a particular roll do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies.   

### Modifier Types  

Note there are also “untyped” modifiers, which do not have a type specified. They stack.   

**Ability Modifier:** The bonus or penalty associated with a particular ability score. Ability modifiers apply to die rolls for character actions involving the corresponding abilities.  

**Ancestry Bonus:** A bonus granted because of the culture a particular creature was brought up in or because of innate characteristics of that type of creature.  

**Armor Bonus:** An armor bonus applies to Armor Class and is granted by armor.   

**Enhancement Bonus:** An enhancement bonus represents the benefit from using an item, often a magic item.   

**Feat Modifier:** A feat modifier comes from one of your feats.   

**Power Modifier:**  A power modifier comes from your or another’s use of a power.   

**Proficiency Bonus:** A bonus to attack rolls from using a weapon in which you are proficient. 

**Shield Bonus:** A shield bonus improves Armor Class and is granted by a shield or by a power or effect that mimics a shield.   

## Rounding Fractions  

In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger.  

*Exception:* Certain rolls, such as damage, have a minimum of 1.  

# Abilities  

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics:  

- **Strength**, measuring physical power  
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance, hardiness and health  
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility, quickness and fine motor skills  
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory  
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight  
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality  
  

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities – a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.  

The three main rolls of the game – the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll – rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.  

## Ability Scores and Modifiers  

Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.  

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches.   

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.  

##### Table – Ability Scores and Modifiers

| Score | Modifier |  
| ----- | -------- |  
| 1     | -5       |  
| 2-3   | -4       |  
| 4-5   | -3       |  
| 6-7   | -2       |  
| 8-9   | -1       |  
| 10-11 | +0       |  
| 12-13 | +1       |  
| 14-15 | +2       |  
| 16-17 | +3       |  
| 18-19 | +4       |  
| 20-21 | +5       |  
| 22-23 | +6       |  
| 24-25 | +7       |  
| 26-27 | +8       |  
| 28-29 | +9       |  
| 30    | +10      |  

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).  

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, skill check, ability check, and defense, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.  

## Using Each Ability  

Many tasks that a character or monster might attempt in the game are covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.  

## Strength  

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.  

### Strength Checks  
The GM might call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks that require brute strength, that do not fall under the Athletics skill. Examples might include:  

- Forcing open a stuck, locked, or barred door  
- Tipping over a statue  
- Keeping a boulder from rolling  
  
### Skill Checks  

Athletics skill checks add your Strength modifier.   

### Attack Rolls and Damage  

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when making a basic attack with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.  

Certain powers use a Strength attack roll and/or add Strength modifier to damage.   

### Fortitude Defense  

Add the higher of your Strength modifier and your Constitution modifier to your Fortitude defense.   

### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.  

**Medium Load:** Your medium load is your Strength score multiplied by 10. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can lift or carry without suffering a penalty, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.  

**Heavy Load:** You can lift or carry a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity. While lifting weight in excess of your carrying capacity, you get the slowed condition.  

**Push or Drag:** You can push or drag a weight in pounds up to five times your carrying capacity. While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, you get the slowed condition.  

## Constitution  

Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.  

### Constitution Checks  

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks that require hardiness and good health, that do not fall under the Endure skill. The Endure skill is broad enough that it would cover most situations that you might otherwise use a Constitution check for, but for example testing to see if you can quaff an entire stein of ale in one go might use a Constitution check since it is not really something you “endure”.   

### Skill Checks  

Endure skill checks add your Constitution modifier.   

### Attack Rolls and Damage  

Certain powers use a Constitution attack roll and/or add Constitution modifier to damage.   

### Fortitude Defense  

Add the higher of your Strength modifier and your Constitution modifier to your Fortitude defense.   

### Hit Points and Recoveries  

Your Constitution contributes to your hit points. You add your Constitution score to your hit point total.   

If your Constitution score changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new score from 1st level.  

You add your Constitution modifier to the number of recoveries that you have.   

## Dexterity  

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.  

### Dexterity Checks  

The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks that require finesse or agility, that do not fall under the Acrobatics, Stealth or Sleight of Hand skills. Examples might include:  

- Steering a chariot around a tight turn  
- Playing a stringed instrument  
- Crafting a small or detailed object  
  
### Initiative  

An initiative check is a special Dexterity check that you make at the beginning of every combat. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.  

### Skill Checks  

Acrobatics, Stealth and Sleight of Hand skill checks add your Dexterity modifier.   

### Attack Rolls and Damage  

You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when making a basic attack with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow, or with a light throwing weapon.   

Certain powers use a Dexterity attack roll and/or add Dexterity modifier to damage.   

### Armor Class and Reflex Defense  

If you wear light or no armor, add the higher of your Dexterity modifier and your Intelligence modifier to your Armor Class and your Reflex defense.   

## Intelligence  

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.  

### Intelligence Checks  

The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks that require quick-wittedness and rationality, that do not fall under the Arcane, History and Religion skills. Examples might include:  

- Estimating the value of a precious item  
- Recalling lore about a craft or trade  
  
### Skill Checks  

Arcana, History and Religion skill checks add your Intelligence modifier.   

### Attack Rolls and Damage  

Certain powers use an Intelligence attack roll and/or add Intelligence modifier to damage.   

### Armor Class and Reflex Defense  

If you wear light or no armor, add the higher of your Dexterity modifier and your Intelligence modifier to your Armor Class and your Reflex defense.   

## Wisdom  

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.  

### Wisdom Checks  

The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks that require perceptiveness and intuition, that do not fall under the Dungeoneering, Heal, Insight and Perception skills. An example could be getting a gut feeling about what course of action to follow.  

### Skill Checks  

Dungeoneering, Heal, Insight and Perception skill checks add your Wisdom modifier.   

### Attack Rolls and Damage  

Certain powers use a Wisdom attack roll and/or add Wisdom modifier to damage.   

### Will Defense  

Add the higher of your Wisdom modifier and your Charisma modifier to your Reflex defense.   

## Charisma  

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.  

### Charisma Checks  

The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks that require charm and personability, that do not fall under the Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate and Streetsmarts skills. An example could be communicating with a creature when you do not share a common language.   

### Skill Checks  

Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate and Streetsmarts skill checks add your Charisma modifier.  

### Attack Rolls and Damage  

Certain powers use a Charisma attack roll and/or add Charisma modifier to damage.   

### Will Defense  

Add the higher of your Wisdom modifier and your Charisma modifier to your Reflex defense.   

## Generating Abilities  

Your character can be assigned ability scores in various ways. Here are three ways.  

These methods are done *before* ancestry bonuses are applied.   

### Point Buy  

You get 32 points to buy your abilities using the chart below.  

You cannot have more than one ability score below 10.   

##### Table – Ability Score Costs

| Ability | Cost |  
|---------|------|  
| 18      | 18   |  
| 17      | 14   |  
| 16      | 11   |  
| 15      | 9    |  
| 14      | 7    |  
| 13      | 5    |  
| 12      | 4    |  
| 11      | 3    |  
| 10      | 2    |  
| 9       | 1    |  
| 8       | 0    |  

### Roll ’em  

Roll 4d6 for each of the six ability scores (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). Drop the low die in each roll. Put the scores into any order to best fit the character you want to play.  

### Standard Array  

Assign 16, 14, 14, 12, 11 and 8, one each to the six ability scores.   

# Personalization  

## Alignment  

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes.   

These brief summaries of the five alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.  

**Lawful good** creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. They follow a strict moral code.   

**Good** folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs.  

**Unaligned** is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time.   

**Evil** is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.   

**Chaotic evil** creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.   

### Variant: Nine-Point Alignment  

In this variant, instead of five alignments there are nine.   

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations. These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.  

- **Lawful good (LG)** creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society.   
- **Neutral good (NG)** folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs.   
- **Chaotic good (CG)** creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect.   
- **Lawful neutral (LN)** individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes.   
- **Neutral (N)** or **True neutral (TN)** is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time.   
- **Chaotic neutral (CN)** creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else.   
- **Lawful evil (LE)** creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order.  
- **Neutral evil (NE)** is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.   
- **Chaotic evil (CE)** creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.  
  
## Languages  

Your ancestry indicates the languages your character can speak by default. Note these languages on your character sheet.  

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table. If you learn a language at a level later than 1, you can also select from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.  

##### Table – Standard Languages

| Language | Typical Speakers | Script   |

## Deities

Crusaders are usually sworn to the service of a particular god. Other characters may worship one or many gods - or none. A sample of gods of worshipped in the Outlaw Kingdoms (the default setting for the Orcus roleplaying game) is given below.   

### Chalavar  

The Glutton  
 **Symbol:** A knife on an empty plate  
 **Portfolio:** Food, feasting, prosperity  
 **Favored Weapon:** Dagger  

A happy and boastful god, Chalavar (CHAL-uh-var) is a welcome visitor to any meal or business gathering, as he makes the food safe and incredibly tasty and the dealings profitable for all involved. Worshipped by people who work with food or conduct trade, Chalavar is a popular deity despite having few actual crusaders. He is shown as a round, pleasant-faced man wearing expensive rings, necklaces, and a jeweled cylindrical hat. He knows the best use for any animal, from the work it is suited for to the other food it complements.  

He also knows the medicinal and culinary use for every plant. His rare temples are popular among adventurers, as Chalavar’s priests love examining the carcasses of strange monsters to see what good can be made of them— for they study the art of cooking with as much ardor as their god.  

Chalavar’s worshippers have many holidays, including the birthdays of famous priests or local nobles, seasonal occurrences, and historical events. These holidays always involve feasting.Worshippers even throw feasts on the holy days of other faiths, knowing that Chalavar gets his thanks whenever someone enjoys a good meal. It is considered bad form to not throw a feast on your own birthday, and wealthier followers of Chalavar show off their prosperity and generosity by holding great birth-feasts with hundreds of guests. Common folk praise Chalavar’s name whenever a meal is extra good or a business deal turns out particularly well.  

### Enoran  

The Old Spirit  
 **Symbol:** Sun setting behind a leafless tree  
 **Portfolio:** Death, the ending of things, mourning  
 **Favored Weapon:** Quarterstaff  

Enoran (EN-or-an) is a god spoken of only rarely, for he represents death from age, as well as the aging and decay of the world over time. He also comforts those who have suffered loss, whether the loss of a family member or the death of a treasured tree. A minor aspect of his faith involves the enactment of vengeance, although he has emphasized this less and less over the centuries.  

He is a sad, quiet deity, weary from carrying on his shoulders the weight of generations of sorrow and death. He is depicted as an impossibly old elf with gray hair and a wrinkled face. Enoran is said to keep a book of names of all the dead, written in his own blood.  

Enoran’s faith has no true holidays, though worshippers sing songs of joy every time someone comes back from the dead. Each day they light black candles in the name of those who died on that day. They fast for the last three days of the year, breaking their fast on the first sunrise of the new year.  

Even devout worshippers rarely speak of Enoran except at funerals and in the wake of battles.  

### Korven  

The Defending Blade  
 **Symbol:** A well-notched short sword  
 **Portfolio:** Defensive tactics, protection, vigilance, Halfling soldiers  
 **Favored Weapon:** Short sword  

A serious-minded deity, Korven (KOR-ven) protects all common folk and inspires them to defend their homes and families when beset by hostile creatures. He and his followers take a more reactive than proactive stance; if people are not threatened, he seems content to remain quiet and fortify, but when people are in danger he is ready to lead them to victory. His followers study traps and fortifications as well as applications of direct force. Under their tutelage even a simple caravan wagon can become a mobile fortress.  

He is rarely depicted, but when he is it is always as a fully-mailed halfling warrior with a battered short sword and metal shield, eyes showing determination from within an open-faced helmet.  

Korven is actually the fourth deity to hold this office. As each fell, their most faithful follower was deified. The cycle of death and renewal gives its current holder an acceptance of death and a tendency toward martyrdom, as he knows his legacy and duties will carry on.  

Korven’s followers celebrate (in somber fashion) the anniversaries of great battles where good people emerged victorious, and they light candles for heroes lost in battle while defending others. Lay people pray to him for protection at the start of a journey and before retiring for the evening, asking for safe travel and safe rest.  

### Larhoon  

The Bloodhunger  
 **Symbol:** Bloody-topped skull  
 **Portfolio:** Killing, murder  
 **Favored Weapon:** Club  

Larhoon (lar-HOON) is an unrelenting, violent deity, said to have sprung from the corpse of the just-murdered god of death, bristling with teeth and horns. He loves death in all its forms, from slow torture to quick disintegration. It is said that Larhoon never sleeps, that he will never rest as long as one creature still remains alive. Larhoon is no fan of the undead, either, and relishes destroying them nearly as much as he does living creatures. He is depicted as a gray-skinned muscular humanoid creature with spines and horns protruding in all places; his only raiment is a belt made of bloody skulls.  

Larhoon spends much of his time alone, searching for new things to kill. He welcomes challenges to his power and has drunk the blood of many godlings and great heroes who thought to slay him.  

Larhoon’s followers celebrate whenever there is a public death (such as an execution), feast on the anniversaries of battles in which many fell, and sacrifice animals to honor the names of famous assassins, murderers, and warlords. His faith consists of many small cults with no central hierarchy. Larhoon’s name has become a curse among the common folk. In less-than-orderly places, criminals are sacrificed to him in hopes of keeping his attention away from others in the community.  

### Kurzana  

The Builder  
 **Symbol:** Carpenter’s hammer with a spider symbol  
 **Portfolio:** Construction, building, weaving, engineering  
 **Favored Weapon:** Hammer  

Kurzana (kur-ZAH-nuh) is an old deity that has changed over time as the people of the world developed their knowledge of building. Originally a goddess of caverns, she took on the mantle of shelters when intelligent creatures began building homes for themselves, and eventually reached her current state, watching over all kinds of building, whether homes, temples, or other structures in a community. She opposes deities of destruction and those that dislike or harm civilization (such as gods of plague). She is depicted as a woman with stony skin, wearing a simple gown and bearing a hammer with a spider on it. Her faith considers killing normal spiders, her chosen animal, bad luck; monstrous spiders that actually constitute a threat are an exception. All building styles intrigue her, and she allies with likeminded deities. Although willing to talk endlessly about engineering, Kurzana remains otherwise a distant deity, having no close friendships with deities who do not share her specialized interests.  

Kurzana’s followers have few holidays, although they do note the dates on which the construction of great buildings began or ended. Although not a particularly martial faith, her priests often move to small communities to establish temples that double as sturdy fortresses, which they open to the entire community when the settlement is threatened. Her priests tend to be scholars in one building style, and sensible folk consult with a member of the church before planning any construction expected to last more than a year. Common folk pray to Kurzana during storms to keep their homes safe and at the groundbreaking of new buildings to bless those within.  

### Kain  

The Black Lord  
 **Symbol:** Horizontal mailed fist  
 **Portfolio:** Tyranny, rulership  
 **Favored Weapon:** Spear  

Kain (KAYN) is a megalomaniacal deity who believes that only the strong are fit to rule, and that he is destined to rule the world and all of the other gods. He makes elaborate plans and spends years watching them unfold, becoming frustrated when the actions of chaotic beings and other meddlers interfere with his plots. His brother is Vogg, a deity of random destruction and one of his frequent opponents, although the two cannot perceive each other directly or be affected by each others’ direct actions. While he hates the forces of good that interfere with his works, he saves his greatest wrath for chaotic fiends, who give no regard to his orders and (in his words) “give evil a bad name.” He is shown as a man with midnight-black skin and glowing eyes, wearing a noble’s clothing of simple cut and dark colors. His left arm is encased in black metallic armor, from which he can pull an iron spear as often as he likes.  

Kain’s church celebrates the anniversaries of great priests’ and tyrants’ birthdays, the first day of every month, and every new moon. These celebrations are more an affirmation of faith in and loyalty to the Black Lord than episodes of revelry. The sacrifice of dissidents or enemies of the church accompanies the rites whenever possible. Few common folk worship Kain, although in places where he holds much political power he is respected for his ability to keep bandits and raiding monsters away. His rule is otherwise harsh.  

### Luna  

 **Symbol:** Three crescent moons arranged in a line  
 **Portfolio:** The moon, feminine power, non-evil lycanthropes  
 **Favored Weapon:** Chakram  

A very old goddess, Luna predates current civilizations. A powerful force for the protection and power of women, her strength has waxed and waned over the centuries. Where the sun is hot and aggressive in its light, the moon remains cool and gentle. She prefers peace to war, and kind words to loud speech, but when someone threatens her charges, she can tear apart her foes with the ferocity of a she-bear defending her cubs. She is also the patron goddess of lycanthropes, and her faith teaches that her light blesses good lycanthropes. Conversely, Luna teaches that evil lycanthropes are corruptions of her gifts to mortals; her followers hunt them down to either cure or kill. She is always shown as a woman with white eyes, dark hair, and a crescent symbol on her forehead, although other details vary. Dogs, wolves, and owls are her sacred animals.  

Luna’s church holds a small ceremony on the first day of each new, full, and quarter moon. Lunar eclipses always call for prayer vigils until the moon appears again, while solar eclipses are sacred events to be celebrated publicly, enjoying the night during the day. Women hold most positions of power in her church, and a disproportionate number of her crusaders are female, but her church neither shuns nor marginalizes men. Common folk invoke Luna’s name at weddings to bless the bride and keep her safe in her husband’s house, at childbirth to guard the expectant mother’s health, and at any time when journeys must be made at night.  

### Shehaan  

Goddess of the Mists, the Mist Goddess  
 **Symbol:** A moon (crescent or full) behind a cloud of mist  
 **Portfolio:** Mist, isolation, concealment  
 **Favored Weapon:** Quarterstaff  

Shehaan (shay-HON) is a reclusive goddess, almost forgotten. Although this should mean her power is dwindling, she draws strength from her great solitude and uses it to protect her faithful. She avoids direct confrontation, preferring to redirect an opponent’s attention, confuse the minds of her enemies, and retreat when victory is not certain. She is shown as an elven woman with wet hair and pale skin, dressed in a gossamer robe or a concealing cloak.  

Like the moon, Shehaan changes. On nights when the moon is new she becomes rather wild, willing to take risks and even reveal her presence when she normally would remain hidden. This change does not affect the abilities of her worshippers, although they, too, seem more willing to take risks on these days.  

Solar eclipses are holy days to the faithful, when her followers given up to the goddess unusual plants and fruits as sacrifices. They go into hiding whenever a lunar eclipse occurs; during these times, which they call the “Night of Madness,” they lose all spellcasting ability, as their goddess goes truly mad and forgets her worshippers entirely. Shehaan always regrets these lapses and apologetically pays closer attention to her followers in the weeks following such an event.  

Where she is worshipped, the common folk pray to her to keep them hidden from the eyes of their enemies and to bring needed rain.  

### Thalander  

Quickheart, Many-Father  
 **Symbol:** White cat surrounded by a red glow  
 **Portfolio:** Vitality, fertility, strength  
 **Favored Weapon:** Longsword  

The boisterous and extroverted Thalander (tha-LANder) embodies the principles of life, survival, and perpetuation of life. Where he walks, plants sprout and animals spring up out of nothing. When he laughs, the air is filled with beautiful birds and insects. Thalander, the greatest foe of the undead, is often depicted blasting them out of existence with great beams of life energy from his hands. Like the cat of his symbol, Thalander has a roving eye and woos many people, whether deity, celestial, or mortal. He has many offspring, some of whom carry his divine blood more strongly than others. Thalander himself is a fair-skinned, redheaded man with a lean but strong build; he is usually shown barefoot, wearing cloth breeches and little else. In some of the more decadent cities his temples double as palaces devoted to the flesh, for his faith teaches that passion and childbirth are needed to remain vital and alive.  

The spring equinox is a day of great celebration, marking the height of Thalander’s power, and worshippers hold weekly feasts throughout the entire spring season. The autumn equinox is their only somber holiday, a remembrance of people met and lives shared in the past growing season, ending on a high note as they look forward to the breaking of winter. Common folk pray to Thalander to bring healthy crops and bless marriages with an abundance of children. They invoke his name at the presentation of a new child to the community, in hopes of ensuring a long and healthy life.  

### Thoin  

The Keeper, the Silent Pick  
 **Symbol:** A gem within a mountain  
 **Portfolio:** Mines, secrets under the earth  
 **Favored Weapon:** Pick  

Thoin (THOH-in) the Keeper is a silent deity of the rewards waiting underground. Not content to dig and sift for treasures, Thoin feels that his followers have a birthright to the Underdeep that authorises them to eliminate all heretics underground so their lesser hands will not profane the treasures with unskilled workmanship. Thoin’s particular hatred is for metal- and gem-eating monsters such as rust monsters, xorn, and metal-addicted delvers.  

Thoin is shown as a long-bearded dwarf made of stone, bearing a great pick or pickaxe, eyes and mouth glowing like sparkling gems or fresh lava. He never speaks, but seems amenable to the company of other earth deities who respect his dogma. His faithful take particular vengeance against thieves, burning them to death with molten rock.  

Followers of Thoin celebrate upon finding a vein of new ore, especially if that ore is mithral or adamantine. They hold weeklong wakes whenever a king or high priest dies and his followers never bury their dead with treasures—they see that as a waste of good metal and an affront to the deceased, as it presumes them incapable of looking for new treasures in the afterlife. Thoin’s churches display their wealth openly as a display of the god’s power and generosity. A temple of Thoin doubles as an armory and fortress, as followers use it as a launching point for attacks on pagan miners and for defense against raiders. Common people pray to Thoin after hard work to find rewards and before battles waged to gain or protect valuable objects.  

### Vaath  

The Laugher  
 **Symbol:** A laughing mouth within a wavy circle  
 **Portfolio:** Humor, irony  
 **Favored Weapon:** Rapier  

Vaath (VOTH) is a well-traveled deity, always on the run from her last escapade. She represents the ability to laugh at frightening or impossible situations as well as the more traditional aspects of humor and irony. She dislikes older, staid deities, preferring to shake things up a bit and see what laughter there is to discover in the world. Depictions of her vary, but she is usually shown as a humanoid woman with a large grin and bright teeth (although she is sometimes shown as a fox or even a man). She trained herself to run faster than the wind, hold her breath for nine days, and speak out of both sides of her mouth; three skills she needed to pull off an elaborate joke on the gods of storms, fire, and cities. She loves recruiting worshippers from serious or wrathful deities just to see the reaction of her divine opponents.  

Vaath’s worshippers pray on a different schedule from month to month, chosen by the deity and revealed at the last minute. Her followers are great fans of All Fool’s Day, where they make up almost unbelievable stories and try to get as many people as possible to fall for them. They honor the birthdays of local nobles with roasts and caricatures, and often celebrate somber holidays of other faiths with loud songs, indecent jokes, and extravagant pranks. Because of these habits, many priests of Vaath use aliases when going about the goddess’ work or use disguises or magic to pretend to worship other deities in order to prevent retaliation. Common people invoke her name in times of good cheer and when things go wrong, in hopes of seeing a more positive side—such as the church’s fable of the plowman’s ox that hurt its leg on a stone, under which lay a nugget of gold.  

### Valkon  

The Sky Lord  
 **Symbol:** Cloud with a lightning bolt  
 **Portfolio:** Air, wind, clouds, ordered nature of the heavens  
 **Favored Weapon:** Longbow  

Valkon (VAL-kahn) is the master of the air and heavens, from the stars to coastal breezes and everything in between. An active and aggressive deity, he loathes chaos, unpredictability, and ancient magical weapons of war that promote those things. This puts him at odds with most other weather deities, who tend to be more carefree and capricious. His celestial messengers are birds, and his temples often use birds to carry messages or spy on their enemies. Valkon enjoys archery and believes it to be a superior form of warcraft to melee fighting. In artwork he is depicted as a tall winged man, lithe but strong, bearing a longbow and having close-cropped fair hair.  

Valkon’s worshippers celebrate the equinoxes and solstices as holy days, as well as the first rainfall in spring and the first snowfall in autumn or winter. Common folk pray to him to bring needed rains or fend off approaching storms, which are always considered to be the work of rival weather gods.  

### Vogg  

The Firelord  
 **Symbol:** An eye surrounded by flame  
 **Portfolio:** Wildfire, destruction, randomness  
 **Favored Weapon:** Mace  

Vogg (VOG) is the embodiment of random destruction. Although he is as intelligent as his brother Kain, he only uses his mind to think up ways to break things faster, louder, and hotter. He is more than content to run about covered in flames of his own creation, setting afire anything he touches or even gazes at for too long.  

He is shown as a humanoid (the type varies by artist and cult) with his skin blackened by great heat, hair of flame, and carrying a mace made of solid fire. Vogg doesn’t really hate anything as much as he is curious about how well and how quickly he can destroy it. He becomes angry when someone places in his way obstacles that he cannot harm, and he becomes livid when someone quenches a fire he sets or dares to try calming him. Vogg would be a more powerful deity if he didn’t have the habit of answering some invocations with blasts of violent fire, which tends to reduce his number of worshippers. He is a friend to fire elementals and tolerates efreet and other fiery creatures.  

Vogg’s worshippers care little for scheduled holidays, but revel in the presence of any great fire, whether naturally occurring or deliberately set. They’re not above setting a fire for the excuse to celebrate. Though most of his followers are too simpleminded to appreciate the destruction of particularly valuable things (such as sacred groves, historic buildings, and so on), they do like watching temples to protective or water deities burn to ash. On the hottest day of the year, members of the church summon as many fire elementals as possible and send them running about, burning whatever they see. In idle times, cult cells are likely to self-destruct, as rival priests set each other on fire as fanatical offerings to their obsessive deity.  

### Yaheine  

The Sword Maiden  
 **Symbol:** Kite shield with a sunburst  
 **Portfolio:** Protection, valor, honor  
 **Favored Weapon:** Bastard sword  

Daughter of the sun god, Yaheine (ya-HEEN) is the faithful guardian, protector of the innocent, and champion of good. Channeling the power of her father, Yaheine strikes out at all evil in her path, making places safe for decent folk. She cannot abide fiends or the undead, and hunts necromancers and demonologists without mercy. She is shown as a tall woman bearing a flashing bastard sword and clad in shining metal armor, her gold hair unbound in a storm about her face like solar flames. When age catches up with her crusaders, they usually take up a leadership role in a community, administering fair law and keeping the peace, ready to bear arms whenever evil raises its head. Her followers respect those who worship the sun god, and the two closely allied churches often share space in the same temple.  

Yaheine’s crusaders pray for their spells at dawn when the leading edge of the sun first becomes visible. Their holy days are the summer solstice and midwinter— said to be the time of year when the sun god’s priests received word that his daughter had been born and would become a champion for all good in the world. Common folk pray to her for fairness in all things, as well as protection in unsafe places. Her name is used to seal oaths as a promise of good intent. 

# Levels, Tiers and Bonuses  

A character’s level, from 1 to 30, describes roughly how powerful they are. Player characters have levels, but so do monsters, traps, items, rituals, diseases, poisons, powers and incantations. Everything with a level also belongs to a tier, which is a rough way of identifying the genre of play.   

The table below shows how many experience points (XP) are required to reach a particular level, and what benefits (ability score increases, feats and features) you get upon doing so.   

##### Table – Levels and Their Benefits

## Level Bonus  

Characters have a level bonus equal to half their level, rounded down, which applies to:   

* defenses  
* attack rolls  
* initiative  
* ability checks  
* skill checks  
  
## Retraining  

If you are unsatisfied with a feat, kit, power or skill you chose, you may trade one old option for a new one each time you gain a level. One retraining per level, only.   

You cannot retrain a feat, skill or power that serves as a requirement for any other character option you have.   

While some details are given below, the key is that retraining is meant to allow the player character to make a different decision, but not a better one. 

The one exception to this rule is feats; because you can meet the requirements for more powerful feats over time, it is acceptable to trade out a weaker feat for a more powerful one once you meet the requirements of the more powerful one.   

**Feat:** The new feat can be any that you meet the requirements of. If you gained the original feat in a special way (e.g. through a class feature), the new selection must have been available to you at the time.   

**Kit:** You can select any kit. You must also retrain any powers that you only had access to thanks to your old kit. 

**Power:** The new power can be any that you meet the requirements of, that is of the same type, level and class as the power you are replacing.  

**Skill:** The new trained skill must have been available to you at the time you selected the old skill.   

## Tiers  

Adventures that take place with Adventurer tier monsters, traps and player characters (i.e. those between levels 1 and 10) will likely be focused on more local issues, like rescuing a village or defeating a clan of orcs. Prestige tier adventures might involve more dramatic concerns, like the fate of kingdoms. You might end up fighting a dragon or rooting out an extraplanar plot to control an entire city. In Epic tier, you may fight the devils that run Hell or save the entire world from devastation.   

The levels correspond to the tiers as follows:   

*Level 1-10:* Adventurer tier  
*Level 11:-20* Prestige tier  
*Level 21-30:* Epic tier  

Tiers do not have a mechanical effect in and of themselves, but they represent a new stage in the player characters’ journeys. An epic character is much more capable than an adventurer character.   


# Powers   
A power is something that your character can do, typically quickly (fast enough to be useful in battle) and with clear rules and effects.  

Since this is a role-playing game, you are not limited by your powers. Anything your character could do, they can attempt to do – even if there are no rules for it. And even if you have a power that says you can do something, the GM may rule that you cannot because it does not fit the fiction.  

Overall, however, powers work the way the rules say they should work almost all of the time.   

## Power Category and Frequency  
There are two categories of power:  

- Attack  
- Utility  
  

An attack power is directed against one or more targets, typically enemies (although you can catch allies in friendly fire in some cases). It usually involves an attack roll which, if it hits, has some kind of negative effect on the target. Some powers also have effects when they miss, or regardless of whether they hit or miss.   

A utility power may affect you, an ally, the environment, etc., but typically not an enemy. They can still serve a function in combat, however.   

There are three frequencies of power:   

- **At-will:** You can use this power as many times as you like.   
- **Encounter:** After using this power, you have to take a short rest before using it again.   
- **Daily:** After using this power, you have to take a long rest before using it again.   
  
## Power Sources  
- **Arcane:** Arcane characters draw their power from their study of magic, pacts with or control over magical beings, or their innate magical talent.   
- **Divine:** Divine characters draw their power from the gods, saints, or devotion to other higher powers.   
- **Natural:** Natural characters draw their power from their connection to the natural, primordial world.   
- **Martial:** Martial characters draw their power from skill at arms, force of will and warcraft.   
  
## Power Description  

When a character uses a power, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the power’s effects.  

Each power description begins with a block of information, including the power’s name, category, source, level, tags, frequency, action required, attack range and targets, and duration.   

The rest of a power entry describes the power’s effects.  

## Action Required  

Most powers require a standard action to use, but some powers require a move action, swift action, immediate action, or other. Some only require a free action.   

Some powers have a “Trigger” listed. You can only use the power if the trigger is satisfied, although you do not have to use the power just because you are able to do so.   

## Tags  

A power’s tags tell you various information about it, which can be relevant for other parts of the game. For example, if you get a +2 bonus on attack rolls with fire powers, that refers to powers with the Fire tag.   

A power with the Weapon tag uses the weapon you are currently wielding to determine some of its effects (typically, at least damage, and often range as well). If the weapon you use the attack power with is one you’re proficient in, add its proficiency bonus to the attack roll. You need a weapon (or an unarmed strike) to use a Weapon power.   

A power with the Focus tag may use the focus you are currently wielding to determine some of its effects.  

## Targeting  

There are four elements to targeting: origin of effect, area of effect, range and targets.   

### Origin of effect  

The five origins of effect for powers are:   

- **Melee:** The power originates with the user, and targets one or more creatures the user can reach with a melee weapon.   
- **Ranged:** The power originates with the user, and either targets one or more creatures the user can reach with a ranged weapon, or targets one or more creatures in a range specified by the power.   
- **Near area:** The power originates in the user’s space and targets squares from there, or creatures in those squares.  
- **Far area:** The power originates in a distant square and targets squares from there, or creatures in those squares.   
- **Self:** The power originates with you and affects only you. You are always within range of yourself.  
  

You can see here that the first four origins can be sorted two different ways: whether the power affects those near the user (Melee, Near) or far from them (Ranged, Far); or whether the power targets creatures directly (Melee, Ranged) or targets an area of effect (Near, Far).   

Ranged and Far powers provoke opportunity attacks. Melee, Close and Self powers do not.   

### Areas of effect  

Areas of effect only apply to Near and Far powers.   

Each Near or Far power describes its area of effect, usually by giving its size and one of the following area types:  

- **Burst:** A burst has an area of effect reaching a number of squares in each direction from the area’s base square equal to its size. For example, a “burst 2” will affect the base square and each square within two squares of the base square.  
- **Arc:** An arc creates a quadratic area of effect where the length of each side is a number of squares equal to the size of the arc. For example, an “arc 2” will create an area two squares on each side (four squares total). The area of effect begins adjacent to the area’s base square.  
- **Wall:** A wall creates an area of effect filling a number of squares equal to the area’s size, starting with a square adjacent to the area’s base square. Each square in the area must share an edge with at least one other square in the area and may not share more than two edges with other squares at the same height. However, wall squares may be stacked on top of each other.  
  

Other areas are possible as specified by individual powers.  

When an area of effect attack affects multiple targets you make a separate attack roll for each of them, but you only roll damage once for all targets. Damage that depends on the attack roll, such as critical hit bonus damage, is rolled separately for each target.  

If a creature that is Large or larger is affected by an area of effect power it is only affected once, even if more than one of its squares are within the area of effect.  

When you make an area of effect attack with a ranged weapon you need one projectile or thrown weapon for each target.  

Special sizes for area of effect are “eyesight” and “earshot”. Eyesight means the target(s) can be anywhere that the user has line of sight. Earshot means the target(s) can be any creature that can hear the user.   

### Range  

For Weapon powers (Melee and Ranged), this is simple: the reach of the melee weapon (usually 1, i.e. adjacent squares only) or the range of the ranged weapon.   

For Ranged powers that are not Weapon powers, the range is usually specified in squares.   

Melee “touch” means the power has range equal to the user’s reach. Medium and Small creatures typically have a reach of 1, and the rules will specify if the creature has a longer reach. This is separate to the user’s weapon’s reach.   

Near powers have no range; they originate with the user and have a set area of effect.   

Far powers have a range specified; the origin square of the area of effect has to be within that range.   

To calculate range, count how many squares are between the user and the target. Remember that diagonal squares are adjacent to one another when you count range.   

### Targets  

Melee and Ranged powers will specify whether they have one or more targets.   

Area of effect powers may target, for example:   

* **all:** every creature in the area of effect  
* **nearest ally:** the nearest ally in the area of effect  
* **nearest enemy:** the nearest enemy in the area of effect  
* **all enemies:** only enemies in the area of effect  
* **all allies:** only allies in the area of effect  
* **any:** one or more targets of the user’s choice in the area of effect.   
  

**Allies and Enemies:** You choose who your allies are when you use a power. Your enemies are any creatures you do not choose as your allies. A creature can choose to not count as your ally for the purposes of a power.   

**A Clear Path to the Target:** To target something with a Ranged or Far power, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.  

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.  

**Line of Sight:** Some effects require your target to be within line of sight. To determine if a target is within line of sight, draw a line from any corner of a square in your space to any part of the target’s space. If you can draw such a line without passing through something that blocks your vision, you can see the target.  

**Line of Effect:** A line of effect is similar to a line of sight, except it is only blocked by solid obstacles. Note that an obstacle can be solid but transparent, meaning it blocks line of effect but not line of sight.  

**Targeting Yourself:** If a power targets a creature of your choice or ally of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a power you use, you can target yourself.  

If a power simply targets “allies in range”, it does not include you.   

**Nearest:** To determine the nearest target, determine the range to each possible target and then pick the one at the shortest range. If the range to two or more targets is equal you can choose which is the nearest.  

## Power Attack Rolls  

Some powers require the user to make an attack roll to determine whether the power effect hits the intended target (one attack roll per target, in the case of a power that targets multiple creatures).   

Your attack bonus with an attack power equals the ability modifier specified in the power + half your level + any other relevant modifiers.  

All attacks target one of the four defenses: Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex or Will.   

## Power Effects  

A power can have three kinds of effects:   

* **Hit:** If the attack roll meets or exceeds the target’s defense.   
* **Miss:** If the attack roll does not meet the target’s defense.   
* **Effect:** This applies regardless of the attack roll result, or if there is no attack roll.   
  

A creature always knows the effect of a power that has affected it.   

## “dW”  
The term “dW” refers to weapon dice. Every weapon has a given damage die. Roll that die as many times as specified, and add up the results. For example, if you use a power with a longsword (weapon die: 1d10), and the Hit effect is “3dW damage” that means you do 3d10 damage. If it is “3dW + Strength modifier damage” and your Strength modifier is +2, you roll three d10s, add them up and then add 2.   

## Duration  
The following are common effects:   

* Until the end of the target’s next turn  
* Until the end of the user’s next turn  
* Until the start of the target’s next turn  
* Until the start of the user’s next turn  
* Save ends  
  

Save ends means you make a saving throw at the end of your turn for every effect that is affecting you. If you roll 10 or higher, you are no longer affected by that effect.   

### Persistent damage  
If a power’s effect includes persistent damage, the target does not take that damage right away. Instead, they take it at the start of their next turn. Usually the duration of persistent damage is “save ends”.   

### Maintain  

Some powers require you to maintain concentration in order to keep functioning. If you lose concentration, such a power ends.  

If a power must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in a Maintain entry, and the power specifies what action is required from you each turn to maintain it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).  

You can maintain any number of powers, provided you have the actions to do so.  

## Boost  

If a power has a “Boost” entry, then the power can be selected at a higher level with the improved effect.   

## Keywords  

### Augmentable

You can use the “Augment:” section of the power that is used. To be able to augment a power, you must be able to expend your *psi focus*, which you gain from being a phrenic.

### Aura

An aura is always a close burst effect, a lingering effect that extends over an area. An aura moves with the character who manifested it and lasts until the end of the encounter, for 5 minutes, or until you use another aura power.

### Conjuration  

A conjuration is an object or monster that is created by a power. It normally cannot be attacked. Allies of its creator can pass through its space but enemies cannot. If it makes attacks or is attacked, it uses the power user’s attack modifiers and defense scores. A conjuration cannot be affected by conditions or persistent damage.   

A conjuration disappears if its creator is killed.   

### Consistent  

If the user of a Consistent power misses on all attacks made with that power, the power is not expended.   

### Form

A Form power changes the shape of the user. Except as described in the power description, the user keeps all other statistics, HP, etc. Use their regular weapon attacks for the attacks of the new form (for example, if you wield a battleaxe and turned into a brown bear, you can use your battleaxe basic attack for the bear’s bite.)

However, a character that has changed form cannot make any attacks that do not make sense in their new form. For example, a brown bear cannot make ranged attacks. 

### Stance  

A stance is a type of fighting method that you maintain from round to round. So long as you stay in a stance, you gain some benefit from it.   

You can use a single swift action to end one stance and begin another, or you can choose to simply end your current stance without entering another. You continue to gain a stance’s benefits until you switch to a new stance or end your current one. You cannot have more than one stance active at a time.   

Your stance ends if you are rendered helpless for any reason.  

### Summons  

A Summons power creates one or more summoned monsters. The summoned monster follows the Companion rules, as well as the following special rules: 

* The summoned monster’s level is equal to the level of the power that summoned it.  
  
* The summoned monster’s maximum HP (and starting HP each time it is summoned) will be specified.   
* Your summoned monster uses your Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses.   
* A summoner can dismiss their summon with a swift action. Otherwise it disappears after five minutes or at the end of the encounter.   
* When your summoned monster drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You lose one recovery or, if not able to lose a recovery, take damage equal to your recovery value.   

### Teleportation  

Unless otherwise specified, teleportation obeys the following rules:   

* You can teleport while prone or while restrained or immobile. You remain prone after your teleport; whether you remain restrained/immobile depends on whether you have left behind what was causing that condition.   
* Teleportation is not affected by the terrain between your start point and your destination.   
* The destination of the teleport must be a space that is unoccupied and can fit the subject of the teleport.   
* The initiator of the teleportation must have line of sight to the destination of the teleport. The initiator may or may not be the subject of the teleportation, depending on whether the teleportation affects the user or another target.   
* Teleportation does not provoke opportunity attacks.   
* Teleportation does not count as unwilling movement, even if the creature does not want to be teleported.   
  

Because a teleport requires line of sight, blindfolding creatures that are capable of teleporting prevents them from escaping.   

### Wild Shape

Unless otherwise mentioned, you cannot use Wild Shape powers unless you are currently under the effect of a power with the Form tag (*wild shape* is the classic example). 

If you cease to be under the effect of a power with the Form tag, all Wild Shape powers end as well. 

### Zones  

A zone is an area of effect that remains for a while, created by a power with the Zone tag. It may be a set duration, or until the creature that created it stops Maintaining it. A zone cannot be attacked, it just is. Squares in a zone do not count as occupied just because there is a zone there.   

A zone disappears if its creator is killed.   

# Combat  

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.  

## Combat Step by Step  
1. **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.  
2. **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶ on the grid.  
3. **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.  
4. **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.  
5. **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.  

## The Grid  
These rules assume you’re using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens to denote positions for participants in the combat.  

Each space on the grid is called a square. The point where four squares meet is a corner, and the line between two squares is an edge.  

Sometimes you need to extend the grid into three dimensions. Each space is still called a square, even though from a geometric point of view it is shaped like a cube. In 3D, a corner is the point where eight squares meet, and edge is used both for the line between two squares meeting diagonally and for the plane between two squares meeting orthogonally. (If geometry is not your thing, don’t worry too much about it. For the most part, the rules make sense even if you don’t understand the exact details of these definitions.)  

Two squares are adjacent if they have at least one corner in common.  

## Surprise  

A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.  

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Stealth checks of anyone hiding with the passive Perception score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.  

If you’re surprised, you can’t take actions on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take immediate actions until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.  

## Initiative  

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes an Initiative check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.  

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Initiative check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.  

If a tie occurs, the creature with the highest initiative modifier goes first. If initiative roll and initiative modifier are tied, flip a coin.   

## Your Turn  

At the start of your turn, take any persistent damage you are subject to.  

On your turn, you can take four types of action, in any order you like, but unless otherwise noted you have to finish one action before you can take another.   

* **One standard action:** E.g., a basic attack. Alternatively, use your standard action to take another move or a swift action.   
* **One move action:** E.g., walking. Alternatively, use your move action to take another swift action.   
* **One swift action:** E.g., drawing or sheathing a weapon.  
* **Any number of free actions (within reason):** E.g., talking.  
  

The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and powers provide additional options for your action.  

You can forgo taking one or more actions, or doing anything at all on your turn.   

### Standard Actions  

Your standard action is typically the main thing that you do in a turn – for example, use a significant power (including most powers that involve attacks), make a basic attack, a charge, etc.   

Actions that use a standard action include:   

* Aid Another  
* Basic Attack  
* Grapple  
* Escape a Grapple  
* Help Attack  
* Help Defense  
* Coup de Grace  
* Charge  
* Rally  
* Shove  
* Total Defense  
  
### Move Actions  

Your move action is almost always used to move, or to use a power that involves movement.   

Actions that use a move action include:  

* Walk  
* Dash  
* Crawl  
* Squeeze  
* Five-Foot Step  
* Stand Up from Prone  
  
### Swift Actions  

The main use of swift actions is for certain powers. Of the four actions usable on your turn (standard, move, swift and free), swift actions are the ones least often used.   

You can also use swift actions to:  

* Interact with an object. For example, you could open a door or you could draw your weapon.  
  
### Free Actions  

You can use free actions to:  

* Communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn or on other characters’ turns.  
* Drop an item.   
* Drop prone.  
* End a grapple (if you are the grappler, not the one being grappled).   
* Spend an action point.  
  

There are also some powers that require a free action.   

### Variant Rule: One Free Action per Turn  

You can only take one free action per turn (including other characters’ turns). For example, you could drop one item on your turn, and then another item on the creature’s turn following yours.   

### Action Points  

A player character’s Action Points are reset to 1 after each long rest. A character gains an additional Action Point after every second encounter they have between long rests.   

Once per encounter (but not during a surprise round), a character can spend an Action Point to take one additional standard, move or swift action during their turn.   

### The End of Your Turn  
At the end of your turn you make saving throws against any effects that require them.   

Any effects that require an action to maintain concentration, which you have not spent, end now.   

Other effects may also resolve at the end of your turn as noted in their descriptions. You can choose in which order to resolve effects that happen at the end of your turn.  

### Saving Throws  

A saving throw – also called a save – represents an attempt to shake off an effect. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm or trying to shake off a condition, persistent damage or other negative effect.  

To make a saving throw, roll a d20. If specified, add other bonuses. If the result is 10 or higher, the save succeeds. Typically, if the save is successful it means the effect ends.   

## Outside of Your Turn  

There are two types of action you can take outside of your turn: immediate actions and opportunity attacks.   

### Immediate Actions   

Certain special abilities, powers, and situations allow you to take a special action called an immediate action. It must occur on someone else’s turn, and you can only take one immediate action between each of your turns.   

Some immediate actions interrupt the other creature’s action. When your immediate action is a **counter** to another creature’s action, their action pauses while your immediate action is resolved. Then that creature can continue its action right after the immediate action ends.  

Other immediate actions are **reactions** to the other creature’s action, and occur after the creature completes their action. That creature can continue its turn right after the immediate action.  

### Opportunity Attacks  

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.  

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach or otherwise provokes an opportunity attack. To make the opportunity attack, you use your immediate action to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.  

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by **shifting**, e.g. by taking the Five-Foot Step action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when subject to unwilling movement. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.  

You can only take one opportunity attack against a creature on their turn, even if they provoke an attack multiple times.   

On rare occasions, you can perform a non-attack action when someone provokes an opportunity attack. These are called “opportunity actions”.   

# Making an Attack  

Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a power, an attack has a simple structure.  

- **Choose a target**. Pick a target within your attack’s **Range:** a creature, an object, or a location. Some attacks will let you choose multiple targets, or choose the targets for you.  
- **Determine modifiers**. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have combat advantage against the target. In addition, powers, class features, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.  
- **Resolve the attack**. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.  
  

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.  

## Attack Rolls  

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s relevant defense, the attack hits.   

As a reminder, defenses are Armor Class (AC), Fortitude, Reflex and Will.   

### Modifiers to the Roll  

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.  

**Ability Modifier:** The ability modifier used for a basic melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a basic ranged weapon attack is Dexterity (except for heavy thrown weapons, which use Strength).   

Powers will specify which ability modifier is used.  

**Proficiency Bonus:** You add a proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency.  

**Combat Advantage:** When an enemy is at a disadvantage defending themselves, you have combat advantage against them. Add +2 to your attack rolls against them.   

### Rolling 1 or 20  

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit or the veteran to miss.  

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s defenses. If the attack hits, and would have hit even if it weren’t for this special rule, then this is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.  

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s defenses.  

## Types of attack  

Attack types are the origins of effect of the attack. The chapter on Powers explained that power origins are Melee, Ranged, Near, Far and Self. Attacks can have any of the first four origins.   

Ranged powers have their range given as a number or they take the range of the weapon used to make the attack. This is the maximum range from the user’s space to the target. Far powers also have a range; the maximum range from the user’s space to the area’s origin square.  

Area of effect powers that use a square in your space as the area’s base square have a range of Near.  

### Melee   

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part.   

Your reach is primarily used to determine which enemies you can make melee attacks against. Tiny creatures have a reach of 0, meaning they must be in the same square as their target to attack them in melee.  

Most creatures have a 1-square **reach** and can thus attack targets within 1 square of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 1 square, as noted in their descriptions. However, note that opportunity attacks are provoked when a creature leaves an *adjacent* square, so even if you have a longer reach you do not make opportunity attacks when they leave your reach.   

A melee attack with a range of **Melee touch** uses the user’s reach, rather than their weapon’s reach.   

### Ranged  

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified number of squares.   

If your target has a space greater than one, it’s enough to reach one of the squares in its space.  

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.  

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has a -2 penalty when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.  

### Ranged and Far Attacks in Close Combat  

Aiming a Ranged or Far attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack (whether it’s with a weapon or not) you provoke an opportunity attack.  

### Two-Weapon Fighting  

When you have a weapon in each hand, you choose which one to use for each attack power.   

### Near and Far   

See Introduction to Powers for more.   

## Unseen Attackers and Targets  

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, turning invisible, or lurking in darkness.  

When you attack a target that you can’t fully see, they have cover or concealment.  

### Cover  

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.  

There are two degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.  

A target with **half cover** gives a -2 penalty to attack rolls. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.  

A target with **three-quarters cover** gives a -5 penalty to attack rolls. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.  

### Concealment  

A target has concealment when some kind of terrain or other effect prevents you from seeing or otherwise perceiving your target clearly. Commonly this is caused by lighting conditions or soft cover such as leaves or fog.   

Like cover, concealment comes in two levels: Concealment (-2 penalty to attack rolls) and total concealment (-5 penalty to attack rolls).  

Concealment penalties do not apply to Near or Far attacks.   

When lighting or other conditions cause creatures in an area to be harder to see, the squares in that area are obscured. A square can be lightly obscured, heavily obscured, or totally obscured.  

Targets in obscured squares gain concealment as follows:  

- A target in a lightly obscured square or an adjacent target in a heavily obscured square has concealment.  
- A non-adjacent target in a heavily obscured square or any target in a totally obscured square has total concealment.  
- An invisible target also has total concealment.  
  
## Damage  

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a *fireball* spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.  

### Hit Points  

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.  

A creature’s **current hit points** (usually just called **hit points**) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.  

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points or below. You can have negative hit points if damage would take you below 0 HP.   

### Damage Rolls  

Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.  

When making a **basic attack**, you add your ability modifier – the same modifier used for the attack roll – to the damage. A **power** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.  

If a power or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts *fireball* or a cleric casts *flame strike*, the power’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.  

### Critical Hits  

When you score a critical hit, you do maximum damage with the attack. When an effect adds bonus dice on a critical hit, roll those extra dice (don’t maximize them).   

### Damage Types  

Different attacks, damaging powers, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.  

Weapons typically don’t have a type of damage. They just do damage. The types are:   

- **Acid:** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.  
- **Cold:** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.  
  
- **Fire:** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.  
  
- **Force:** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells.  
- **Lightning:** A lightning bolt and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.  
- **Necrotic:** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as *chill touch*, withers matter and even the soul.  
- **Poison:** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.  
  
- **Psychic:** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.  
  
- **Radiant:** Radiant damage, like that dealt by an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.  
- **Thunder:** A concussive burst of sound deals thunder damage.  
### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability  

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.  

If a creature or an object has **resistance to X #**, damage of type X is reduced by #. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability to X #** to a damage type, whenever it takes damage of type X it takes +# damage.  

# Movement and Position  

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.  

Move actions include:   

* **Walk:** Move a distance up to your speed.   
* **Five-Foot Step:** Shift one square. Shifting is a form of movement that does not provoke opportunity attacks.   
* **Dash:** Move a distance up to your speed +2, with penalties.   
* **Crawl:** Move a distance up to half your speed, even if prone.   
* **Stand Up from Prone:** Stop being prone.   
  

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.  

Moving from one square to another that is diagonal to it counts for 1 square of movement, just as moving orthogonally (forward, back, left and right) does.   

## Speed  

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the number of five-foot squares that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.  

### Using Different Speeds  

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a fly speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.  

For example, if you have a speed of 6 and a fly speed of 12 because a wizard cast the *fly* spell on you, you could fly 4 squares, then walk 2 squares, and then leap into the air to fly 6 squares more.  

## Additional Movement Modes

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.  

**Compress** means that the monster can travel through spaces as if it were one size smaller without squeezing, or as if it were two sizes smaller while squeezing.  

### Burrow  

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.  

**Earth glide** means the creature can burrow through earthen matter, including rock. When it does so, it moves at its full burrow speed, leaving no tunnels or signs of its passing.

### Climb  

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.  

**Wall-climber** means that the monster does not have to make Athletics checks to climb, even while climbing upside down.   

### Fly  

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly.  

If a monster is flying, it typically has to move at least 2 squares per round, or it crashes to earth. It cannot shift or make opportunity attacks while flying.   

Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard to knock out of the air. Such a monster stops hovering when it dies. A hovering monster does not have to move at least 2 squares per round, can shift and can make opportunity attacks.   

Some monsters will specify how high they can fly (“maximum altitude”), in squares. If they fly beyond that height, they crash.   

If a creature has the **clumsy on ground** trait, they suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls and defenses while on the ground. If a creature has the **clumsy in air** trait, they suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls and defenses while flying.   

### Swim  

A monster that has a swim speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.  

### Phasing  

A monster with phasing can move through difficult terrain, obstacles (like walls) and creatures (including enemies) without penalty.   

### Terrain stride  

Terrain stride describes a set of traits, each of which allows the monster to ignore difficult terrain in some conditions:   

* Ice stride: Ignore difficult terrain in the form of ice, snow or slurry.  
* Swamp stride: Ignore difficult terrain in the form of mud, marsh or shallows. You also cannot be trapped in quicksand or sticky mud. 
* Stone stride: Ignore difficult terrain in the form of broken ground, uneven stone or rubble.   
* Woodland stride: Ignore difficult terrain in the form of shrubbery, trees or plants.   
* Web stride: Ignore difficult terrain in the form of webs, like those from a spider. You also cannot be trapped in webs.  
* Versatile stride: Ignore all difficult terrain.  

## Difficult Terrain  

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases-the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.  

Every square of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra square. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.  

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain.   

## Being Prone  

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.  

You can **Drop Prone** as a free action. **Stand Up from Prone** is a move action.  

To move while prone, you must **Crawl** or use magic such as teleportation (you remain prone after teleporting, but at least you move). Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra square, and you provoke opportunity attacks while crawling.   

## Moving Around Other Creatures  

You can move through an allied creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you.   

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.  

If you leave a square adjacent to an enemy, e.g. by moving into their space, you provoke an opportunity attack.  

## Flanking  

When making an attack, you have combat advantage if your opponent is flanked, that is to say an ally is on the opponent’s opposite border or opposite corner.  

Only a creature or character that can attack the defender can help an attacker flank. For example, a creature without attacks or that is unconscious cannot contribute to a flank.   

## Creature Size  

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.  

##### Table – Size Categories

| Size       | Squares Taken Up                  |  
|------------|------------------------|  
| Tiny       | 0.5 x 0.5     |  
| Small      | 1 x 1            |  
| Medium     | 1 x 1            |  
| Large      | 2 x 2           |  
| Huge       | 3 x 3           |  
| Gargantuan | 4 x 4 or more |  

### Space  

A creature’s space is the area in squares that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A square is 5-feet by 5-feet, but a typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a square. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a square, other creatures can’t get through that square unless the hobgoblin lets them.  

### Unwilling Movement  

When an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the distance you move is defined by the effect that moved you, not by your speed. Because you’re not acting to move, this doesn’t trigger reactions that are triggered by movement.  

If unwilling movement would move you into a space you can’t occupy—because objects are in the way or because you lack the movement type needed to reach it, for example—you stop moving in the last space you can occupy. Usually the creature or effect forcing the movement chooses the path the victim takes.   

Unwilling movement can usually move you through hazardous terrain, pushed off a ledge, or the like. However, you may make a saving throw before being moved into hazardous terrain – and on a success you fall prone at the edge instead of being moved.  

The three forms of unwilling movement are:   

* *Push X:* The creature is moved X squares, as the attacker chooses, but each move must be away from the attacker (or from the origin of the attack, if it is a Far attack).  
* *Pull X:* The creature is moved X squares, as the attacker chooses, but each move must be towards the attacker (or towards the origin of the attack, if it is a Far attack)  
* *Shunt X:* The creature is moved X squares, as the attacker chooses.   

## Overland Movement

Creatures can walk a number of miles per hour equal to half their walk speed in squares. For example, the standard (unencumbered) human speed is 6 squares, which translates to 3 miles per hour. 

Creatures can comfortably walk for five hours a day (15 miles total).

Creatures can push on and walk for another five hours a day with an Endure check (DC 20). If they fail, they lose a recovery and cannot hustle or push on until after a long rest. 

Creatures can hustle, moving at double their walking speed (6 miles per hour for a standard, unencumbered human). However, at the end of each hour they hustle they must make an Endure check (DC 15 + 5 for each hour spent hustling). If they fail, they lose a recovery and cannot hustle or push on until after a long rest. 

# Actions in Combat  

When you take actions on your turn, you can take the actions presented here, use powers, and/or actions that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.  

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.  

### Aid Another (standard action)  

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a skill check. See the Aid Another section of the Skills chapter.   

### Basic Attack (standard action)  

With this action, you make a melee basic attack or a ranged basic attack.  

> #### Basic Melee Attack  
> **At-Will** **Attack** **Feature** (**Standard Action**) ● **Weapon**  
> **Melee** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack** Strength vs AC  
> **Hit** 1dW + Strength modifier damage.  
*Level 21:* 2dW + Strength modifier damage.  

> #### Basic Ranged Attack  
> **At-Will** **Attack** **Feature** (**Standard Action**) ● **Weapon**  
> **Ranged** weapon, one creature  
> **Attack** Dexterity vs AC  
> **Hit** 1dW + Dexterity modifier damage.  
*Level 21:* 2dW + Dexterity modifier damage.  
> **Special:** Heavy thrown weapons use Strength not Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.   

### Charge (standard action)  

You must move at least 2 squares. You must move to the closest square from which you can attack the opponent. (If this square is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can’t charge.) Your movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal movement does.   

After moving, you may make a single basic melee attack or shove. You get a +1 bonus on the attack roll.   

### Coup de Grace (special)  

When you make an attack (including using an attack power) against a helpless adjacent opponent, using a standard action, it is a Coup de Grace.   

If you hit, you score a critical hit. If the damage equals or exceeds their staggered value, they die. Otherwise they just take the damage.   

### Crawl (move action)  

When you take the Crawl move action, you move half your speed. Your movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal movement does.   

You cannot Walk or Dash while prone, which is why you might choose the Crawl action.   

### Create Diversion (standard action)

> #### Create Diversion  
> **Encounter** **Attack** **Feature** (**Standard Action**)   
> **Near** eyesight, all enemies  
> **Attack** Bluff check vs target's passive Insight score  
> **Hit** You have the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Stealth check while people are aware of you.  

### Dash (move action)  

When you take the Dash move action, you move your speed +2. Until the end of your next turn, you grant combat advantage and suffer a -5 penalty to attacks.  

Your movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal movement does.   

### Deter (standard action)

> #### Deter  
> **At-Will** **Attack** **Feature** (**Standard Action**)   
> **Near** eyesight or earshot, one enemy  
> **Attack** Intimidate check vs Will. Targets get a +5 bonus to their Will defense if unfriendly, or +10 if hostile. They gain a further +5 bonus if you do not speak in a language that they understand.  
> **Hit** The target cannot take an action of your choice until the end of their next turn.  
> **Miss** The target cannot be the target of your Deter or Unnerve action again until the end of this encounter.  
> **Effect** The target becomes hostile if it was not already.  

### Feint (standard action)

> #### Feint  
> **Encounter** **Attack** **Feature** (**Standard Action**)   
> **Near** burst 1, one enemy  
> **Attack** Bluff check vs target's passive Insight score  
> **Hit** You gain combat advantage against the target until the end of your next turn.  

### Five-Foot Step (move action)  

If you take the Five-Foot Step move action, you shift 1.  

### Delay (N/A)  

By choosing to delay, you take no actions and then take your turn normally on whatever initiative count you decide to act. When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your own initiative result for the rest of the combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally. You can specify this new initiative result or just wait until some time later in the round (in between other creatures’ turns) and act then, thus fixing your new initiative count at that point.  

If you do not take your turn by the end of the round, your turn for that round is wasted.   

You can’t interrupt anyone else’s turn (as you can with the Ready action).  

You cannot Delay if you have already taken actions this turn.   

You cannot maintain powers if you Delay. Beneficial effects that end at the end of your turn end as soon as you Delay.   

**Initiative Consequences of Delaying:** Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed turn.   

### Grapple (standard action)  

> #### Grapple  
> **At-Will** **Attack** **Feature** (**Standard Action**) ● **Weapon**  
> **Melee** touch, one enemy no more than one size larger than you  
> **Requirements** You must have a hand free.  
> **Attack** Strength vs Reflex  
> **Effect** The target is grappled. You can release the target whenever you like (as a free action). If either of you ceases to be adjacent to the other (e.g. through unwilling movement affecting one or the other of you), the grapple ends.  
> **Special** You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated.  

**Escape a Grapple (standard action):** A grappled creature can use its standard action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on an Athletics check vs the grappler’s Fortitude or Acrobatics check vs the grappler’s Reflex defense.   

**Move a Grappled Creature (standard action):** Make a Strength attack vs the grappled creature’s Fortitude.   

*Hit:* You can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved. Your movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal movement does.   

### Help Attack (standard action)  

You can aid a friendly creature in fighting a creature within your reach. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective.   

You grant a +2 bonus to your ally’s next attack roll against that target (if not used, this bonus expires at the end of your next turn).   

### Help Defense (standard action)  

You can aid a friendly creature in fighting a creature within your reach. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s defense more effective.   

You grant a +2 bonus to your ally’s defenses against the target’s next attack against them (if not used, this bonus expires at the end of your next turn).   

### Rally (standard action)  

> #### Rally  
> **Encounter** **Utility** **Feature** (**Standard Action**)   
> **Self**   
> **Effect** You spend one of your recoveries and regain your recovery value in HP. You also get +2 to all defenses until the start of your next turn.  

### Ready (N/A)  

The ready action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your turn is over but before your next one has begun. Readying is a standard action.   

You can ready a standard action, a move action, or a swift action. To do so, specify the circumstances under which you will take it. Then, any time before your next turn, you may take the readied action in response to those circumstances. The action occurs just before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of another character’s activities, you interrupt the other character. Assuming the other character is still capable of doing so, they continue their actions once you complete your readied action. Your initiative result changes. For the rest of the encounter, your initiative result is the count on which you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead of the character whose action triggered your readied action.  

**Initiative Consequences of Readying:** Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the readied action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same action again). If you take your readied action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.  

### Shove (standard action)  

> #### Shove  
> **At-Will** **Attack** **Feature** (**Standard Action**) ● **Weapon**  
> **Near** burst 1, one enemy that is no more than one size larger than you  
> **Attack** Strength vs Fortitude  
> **Hit** You push the target 1 square and may shift into the space it left.  

### Stand Up from Prone (move action)  

Standing up from a prone position requires a move action. If there is another creature already in your space, shift 1 into an unoccupied square.   

### Squeeze (move action)  

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra square for every square it moves there, and attack rolls against the creature have combat advantage while it’s in the smaller space.  

You provoke opportunity attacks as you would with normal movement.  

While squeezing, you grant combat advantage and suffer a -5 penalty to attacks.   

### Total Defense (standard action)  

You can defend yourself as a standard action. When you take the Total Defense standard action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks.   

+2 to all defenses until the start of your next turn.   

### Treat Ally (standard action)

Choose one each time you take this action. 

_First Aid (Heal DC 15)_: An adjacent dying character is stabilized. A stable character stops making death saves.  

_Additional Saving Throw (Heal DC 15):_ A successful Heal check allows an adjacent ally to either (their choice) make a new saving throw right away or take a +2 bonus on a saving throw of their choice at the end of their next turn.   

_Treat Wound (DC 10)_: A successful Heal check allows an adjacent ally to use their second wind without spending a standard action. They don’t get the standard bonus to defense if they choose to use it this way.   

### Unnerve (standard action)

> #### Unnerve  
> **At-Will** **Attack** **Feature** (**Standard Action**)   
> **Near** eyesight and earshot, all staggered enemies  
> **Attack** Intimidate vs Will +10. Targets get a further +5 bonus if you do not speak in a language that they understand.  
> **Hit** The target surrenders.  
> **Miss** The target cannot be the target of your Deter or Unnerve action again until the end of this encounter.  

### Use a Power (various actions)  

You use a power. If it is an attack power, you will typically follow all the standard steps of an attack.   

### Walk (move action)  

When you take the Walk move action, you move your speed. You provoke opportunity attacks.  

# Healing  

Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion of healing* can remove damage in an instant.  

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.  

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the *revivify* spell has restored it to life.  

### Recoveries  

Each PC has a certain amount of **recoveries**, which represent the PC’s ability to heal or bounce back from damage. Many healing spells and potions require you to use up a recovery. So does rallying during a battle.  

When you use a recovery, regain lost hit points equal to your recovery value.   

**Recovery Value:** Equal to one-quarter your maximum HP.   

### Staggered  

When you are reduced to half your maximum hit points or fewer, you’re **staggered**. Some powers, spells, and monster interactions work differently when you are staggered.  

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points or Below  

When you drop to 0 hit points or below, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.  

### Healing on Negative HP  

Whenever you receive healing while you are at negative HP, simply add the healing to 0 to determine your current HP.   

For example, if you are on -10 HP and you heal 7 HP, your HP become 7, *not* -3.   

### Instant Death  

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to negative hit points equivalent to your staggered value or worse (e.g. -22 HP if your HP is 44), you die.   

### Falling Unconscious  

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points or below and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.  

### Death Saving Throws  

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points or below, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by powers and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.  

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of failures is reset to zero when you take a short or long rest.   

**Rolling 20 or higher:** When you make a death saving throw and roll 20 or higher, you can spend a recovery. Your HP are set to equal to your recovery value, and therefore you stop dying and become conscious, although you are still prone. If you have no recoveries to spend, treat this result as a 19.   

### Stabilizing a Creature  

If a dying creature gets the opportunity to spend a recovery to heal but it has no recoveries left, its HP is set to 1 only.   

### Monsters and Death  

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.  

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.  

### Variant: No Negative HP  

In this variant, characters never go below 0 HP. They only die from hit point loss (rather than from failed death saves) if a single attack would reduce them to negative hit points equal to their staggered value or worse.   

*For example, a cleric with 22 HP takes 23 damage. They fall to 0 HP. They then take an attack that does 7 damage. Since it is less than their staggered value, they stay at 0 HP. Then they take an attack that does 13 damage – since that exceeds their staggered value, they die.*  

## Knocking a Creature Out  

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious. It heals 1 HP after a short rest.  

## Temporary Hit Points  

Some powers and features confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.  

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.  

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.  

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.  

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.  

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a short rest.  

## Regeneration  

Creatures with this extraordinary ability automatically heal damage at a fixed rate at the start of each of their turns, as given in the creature’s entry.  

 If you have regeneration and receive it from another source, you receive the highest value (do not sum them).  

# Conditions  

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a power, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments.  

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.  

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.  

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.  

### Blinded  

- You can’t see and automatically fail any ability or skill check that requires sight.  
- Attack rolls against you have combat advantage.  
- -10 penalty to Perception.  
- Cannot flank.  
  
### Controlled  
- You are dazed.  
- The creature controlling you decides what actions you take, but they can’t make you spend action points or encounter or daily powers.  
  
### Dazed  

- Attack rolls against you have combat advantage.  
- Cannot flank.  
- You can only take one standard action on your turn (though you can take free actions as normal). You can convert the standard action to a move or swift action if you like.   
- You can’t take immediate or opportunity actions.  
  
### Deafened  

- You can’t hear and automatically fail any ability or skill check that requires hearing.  
- -10 penalty to Perception.  
  
### Dying  
- You make a death saving throw at the end of each of your turns.  
- You are unconscious.  
  
### Helpless  
- Attack rolls against you have combat advantage.  
  
### Immobile  

- You cannot willingly move into another square.   
  
### Marked  
* -2 penalty to attack rolls on attacks that do not include the creature that marked you as a target.  
* If the creature that marked you dies or falls unconscious, you lose the marked condition.   
* If you are marked by another creature while already marked, the new mark supersedes the old one (in other words, you cannot be marked by two different creatures at the same time).  
  
### Petrified  

- You are transformed into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone).   
- You can’t move or speak, and are unaware of your surroundings.  
- You can’t take any actions.  
- Attack rolls against you have combat advantage.  
- Resistance to all 20.  
- You do not age.  
  
### Prone  

- Your only movement option is to Crawl, unless you stand up and thereby end the condition. If you are climbing or flying when you become prone, you fall to the ground.   
  - A flying creature that falls prone descends squares up to its fly speed and then falls the rest of the way.  
- -2 to attack rolls.  
- Melee attack rolls against you have combat advantage.  
- +2 to AC, Fortitude, Reflex and Will defense against ranged attacks (unless attacker is adjacent to you).  
  

### Rattled

* -2 penalty to attack rolls. 

### Restrained  

- You cannot be moved into another square, willingly or with unwilling movement.  
- -2 penalty to attack rolls.  
- Attack rolls against you have combat advantage.  
  
### Slowed  
- Your speed for any form of movement other than teleportation is reduced to 2 if it was higher than 2.  
  

The slowed condition setting your speed to 2 applies *after* all other modifiers to your speed have been applied. For example, if you are subject to a power that gives you a -2 penalty to speed, and your speed is normally 6, then your speed while slowed is 2.   

However, note that slowed affects your speed, not your movement. For example, if you take the Dash action (allowing you to move your speed +2), you can move 4 since your speed is 2.   

### Stunned  

- You are incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.  
- Attack rolls against you have combat advantage.  
- You can’t take actions or reactions.  
- Cannot flank.  
  
### Surprised  

- Attack rolls against you have combat advantage.  
- On your turn, you can only take a single standard action.  
- You can’t take free actions.  
- You can’t flank.  
- You lose this condition when the surprise round ends.  
  
### Unconscious  
- You can’t take any actions.  
- You can’t flank.  
- You suffer a -5 penalty to all defenses.  
- When you become unconscious you also fall prone.  
  
### Weakened  

- The damage of your attacks is halved, except persistent damage.  
  
# Adventuring  

## Companions

Companions are creatures that accompany you on your adventures, like animal companions, familiars and summoned monsters. 

Each type of companion has some special rules, as well as following these standard rules. 

*Actions*  

* Your companion’s initiative equals your own.
* You can give up actions to command the companion, in which case it gets to take the same actions. For example, you can give up your standard action in order for the summoned monster to take a standard action. You can also use an immediate action in order for the animal companion to make an opportunity attack or use a counter or reaction (in all three cases, only if eligible to do so). 
* Some companions have an “Instinct“ listed. This is how the monster behaves when you do not command it. It has the normal standard, move and swift action when following its instinct, and acts at the end of your turn.    

*Stats and Combat*  

* Your companion typically has no recoveries of its own, but can use yours.   
* Whenever you have the chance to spend a recovery to heal, you can spend a second recovery to heal your companion your recovery value. 
* What happens to a companion when it drops to 0 hit points depends on the type of companion.  
* Companions can contribute to a flank.   

*Other*  

* Your companion always obeys your commands.  
* If you retrain, you can select a different companion from the list available. 
* Your companion is an ally of you, and of your allies.  

## Time  

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.  

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.  

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.  

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time.  

## Falling  

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d10 damage for every 2 squares (10 feet) it fell, to a maximum of 50d10. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.  

## Vision and Light  

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring – noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few – rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.  

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured.   

- In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, a creature has partial concealment.   
- In a **heavily obscured** area – such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage – a creature has full concealment, except for creatures adjacent to it (where it has partial concealment)  
  
  

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.  

- **Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.  
- **Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.  
- **Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area.  
  

Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.  

### All-Around Vision  

A creature with all-around vision cannot be flanked.  

### Blindsight  

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.  

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.  

### Darkvision  

Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. A creature with darkvision can see in darkness or dim light as if it were bright light.   

### Tremorsense  

A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs, have this special sense.  

### Truesight  

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.   

## Resting  

Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits, and brace themselves for further adventure.  

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.  

### Short Rest  

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least five minutes long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.  

### Long Rest  

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 6 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.   

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period.  

### Streak  

After every two encounter that the heroes have without stopping for a long rest, they gain an action point. This is called completing a streak, and some powers and features also work off of it.
