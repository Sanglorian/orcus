# Ancestries  

A character's ancestry reflects their upbringing before becoming an adventurer. This can be “nature” or “nurture”, or both. For example, one game of Orcus might have characters choose a species origin for their ancestry: dwarf, human, elf, and so on. See the Advanced Options section for more details on ancestries as species. 

The default ancestry rules presented here assume that all characters are human, or that their genetic makeup matters less than other details about them. A player chooses two details for their character: their “crux” and their “heritage”. 

If the two halves of your ancestry give a bonus to the same skill, choose any other skill for the second bonus. 

## Humanity  

Not all heroes in the Outlaw Kingdoms are human, but the differences between species matter less than the background that a hero comes from and the moment that marked them for greatness. All heroes have the following traits:   

**Size:** Your size is Medium.  

**Ability Scores:** +2 to two ability scores of your choice. 

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.  

**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.   

## Sidebar: The implied setting of Orcus

On the outskirts of the Empire hang the hundred and eight Outlaw Kingdoms, a motley collection of clans, city-states, marks, principalities, vassaldoms and - yes - even a few kingdoms. The formidable mountains and deep river valleys frustrate invaders, giving the people here a hard-won independence - but the Empire casts a long shadow.   

## Cruxes

# Skills  

A skill check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for a skill check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.  

**Using Skills**: To make a skill check, roll:  

**1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = +5 if you are trained in the skill + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)**  

This roll works just like an attack roll – the higher the roll, the better. Either you’re trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you’re trying to beat another character’s check result.  

**Ability Modifier**: The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill’s key ability (the ability associated with the skill’s use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.  

**Miscellaneous Modifiers**: Miscellaneous modifiers include ancestry bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.  

## Using Skills  

When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well they do. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.  

Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise they would fail.  

## Skill Checks  

A skill check takes into account a character’s training (skill training), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account their ancestry's knack for doing certain things (ancestry bonus) or what armor they are wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things.  

To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character’s skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character’s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill’s key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including ancestry bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.  

### Difficulty Class  

Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.  

##### **Table – Recommended Difficulty Classes by Level**  

| Level | Easy | Moderate | Hard |  
|-------|------|----------|------|  
| 1     | 8    | 12       | 18   |  
| 2     | 9    | 13       | 19   |  
| 3     | 9    | 14       | 20   |  
| 4     | 10   | 14       | 21   |  
| 5     | 10   | 15       | 22   |  
| 6     | 11   | 16       | 22   |  
| 7     | 11   | 16       | 23   |  
| 8     | 12   | 17       | 24   |  
| 9     | 12   | 18       | 25   |  
| 10    | 13   | 19       | 26   |  
| 11    | 13   | 19       | 26   |  
| 12    | 14   | 20       | 27   |  
| 13    | 14   | 21       | 28   |  
| 14    | 15   | 21       | 29   |  
| 15    | 15   | 22       | 30   |  
| 16    | 16   | 23       | 30   |  
| 17    | 16   | 23       | 31   |  
| 18    | 17   | 24       | 32   |  
| 19    | 17   | 25       | 33   |  
| 20    | 18   | 26       | 34   |  
| 21    | 18   | 26       | 34   |  
| 22    | 19   | 27       | 35   |  
| 23    | 19   | 28       | 36   |  
| 24    | 20   | 28       | 37   |  
| 25    | 20   | 29       | 38   |  
| 26    | 21   | 30       | 38   |  
| 27    | 21   | 30       | 39   |  
| 28    | 22   | 31       | 40   |  
| 29    | 22   | 32       | 41   |  
| 30    | 23   | 33       | 42   |  

### Opposed Checks  

An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.  

### Trying Again  

In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.  

### Untrained Skill Checks  

Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill they do not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn’t have a skill training bonus added. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill’s key ability, are applied to the check.  

Certain uses of some skills are only available to someone who is trained in that skill.  

### Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions  

Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.  

The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.  

1.  Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.  
2.  Give the skill user a –2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.  
3.  Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.  
4.  Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.  

Conditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.  

### Time and Skill Checks  

Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions or move actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action. These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.  

### Checks without Rolls  

A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.  

**Taking 10**: When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure – you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help.  

**Ability Checks**: The normal take 10 rules apply for ability checks.  

**Passive Checks**: A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.  

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:  

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check  

The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.  

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and training in Perception, they have a passive Perception score of 17.  

## Combining Skill Attempts  

When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.  

### Group Checks  

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.  

To make a group check, everyone in the group makes the skill check (or, in rare cases, the ability check). If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.  

Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a Nature group check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.  

### Aid Another  

You can help another character achieve success on their skill or ability check by making the same kind of check in a cooperative effort. The DC is 10 + half your level. If you succeed, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to their check. If you fail, the character you are helping gets a -1 penalty to their check.   

In many cases, a character’s help won’t be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.  

In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can’t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn’t achieve alone.  

## Ability Checks  

Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you’re making an untrained skill check.  

In some cases, what is needed is a straight test of one’s ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn’t make a height check to see who is taller, you don’t make a Strength check to see who is stronger.  

# Skill Descriptions   

This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.  

Here is the format for skill descriptions.  

## Skill Name  

The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.  

**Key Ability**: The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check.   

**Example Uses**: Suggestions for how the skill can be used.   

**Trained Only**: If this notation is included for an example use, you must be trained in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used untrained.   

**Armor Check Penalty**: If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.  

The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other types of information:  

## Skills  
* Acrobatics (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)  
* Arcana (Int)  
* Athletics (Str, Armor Check Penalty)  
* Bluff (Cha)  
* Diplomacy (Cha)  
* Dungeoneering (Wis)   
* Endure (Con, Armor Check Penalty)  
* Heal (Wis)  
* History (Int)  
* Insight (Wis)  
* Intimidate (Cha)  
* Perception (Wis)  
* Religion (Int)  
* Sleight of Hand (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)  
* Stealth (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)   
* Streetsmarts (Cha)  
### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities  

Normally, a set ability modifier applies to all checks with a particular skill. For example, Athletics checks add your Strength modifier.   

In some situations, though, a different ability might reasonably apply. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a different modifier.   

### Contests  
Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In contests like these, the outcome is determined by an opposed check.  

An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher check modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.  

### Knowledge  
Five skills – Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Nature and Religion – can be used to test a character's knowledge about a particular topic. General knowledge should have an Easy DC, knowledge that is based on specialization in a field a Moderate DC and obscure, hidden or secret knowledge a Hard DC.   

### Monster Knowledge  

To test what you know about a monster, make a skill check against a Moderate DC (using the level of the monster, not the player character, to determine the DC). On a success, you learn its name, ancestry, type, tags and standard temperament.

If you also beat the Hard DC, you also learn its powers, its resistances and immunities and its vulnerabilities.

Use Arcana for elemental, fey and shadow creatures, and creatures with the construct tag. Use Dungeoneering for aberration creatures. Use Religion for outsider creatures, and creatures with the undead tag. Use Nature for natural creatures.  

## Acrobatics (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)  
Acrobatics covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for an Acrobatics check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.  

### Balance  
You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can’t move for the rest of the action. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface.  

_Being Attacked while Balancing_: If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Acrobatics check against the same DC to remain standing.  

### Escape Restraints  

Your Acrobatics check is opposed by a DC based on the type of restraint. It takes five minutes, or a standard action if you take a -10 penalty on the check. If you fail the check, you can only try again if someone is in a position to assist you with Aid Another.   

### Escape a Grapple  

See the Escape action.   

### Fall with Style (Trained Only)  
Make an Acrobatics check while falling to reduce damage. You take less damage equal to half the Acrobatics check result (for example, if your result is 23, you take 11 less damage). If you take no damage, you land on your feet (i.e., not prone).  

## Arcana (Int)  
Your Arcana check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.  

### Detect Magic (Trained Only)  
You sense the presence of magic.  

**Identify Persistent Power (swift action):** Make an Arcana check against a power you can see with the Conjuration, Summons or Zone tags (DC 15 + 1/2 power's level). On a success, you learn the power's name, tags and tradition. On a failure, you must take a short rest before trying to identify that particular power again.   

**Identify Magical Things (standard action):** Make an Arcana check against an environmental magical effect or the results of an incantation (hard DC). On a success, you identify the name of the phenomenon, any tags it might have or tradition it comes from, and its general purpose. If it is the result of an incantation, you learn the incantation's names and the basics of its effects. On a failure, you must take a long rest before trying to identify that particular thing again.   

**Sense Magic (standard action):** You attempt to sense the presence of magic within 5 + your level squares.   

For each magical thing in range:   

* If its level is your level -5 or less, you automatically learn its tradition and location.   
* If its level is greater than your level -5, make an Arcana check (hard DC) to learn its tradition and location.   
  
## Athletics (Str)  

*Armor Check Penalty applies*

Athletics covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:  

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.  
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.  
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.  
  
### Climb  
With a successful Athletics check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at half your normal speed.   

An Athletics check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.  

Each square climbed costs one extra square of movement (so if you have a speed of 6, with a move action you can climb 3).   

Any time you take damage while climbing, make an Athletics check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.  

_Catching Yourself When Falling_: It’s difficult to catch yourself while falling. Make an Athletics check (DC = wall’s DC + 5) to do so.   

### Escape a Grapple  

See the Escape action.   

### Jump  

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.  

**Long Jump:** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of *squares* equal to the check result divided by 10 (standing long jump) or divided by 5 (if you move at least 2 squares immediately before the jump). If the jump is successful, you land in the square beyond the square you jumped over.   

Either way, each square you clear on the jump costs a square of movement.  

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. If you clear at least one square, the vertical height of your jump is 2 feet + the number of squares you could clear. E.g. if your jump could clear a 4-square gap, the vertical height is 6 feet.   

**High Jump:** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of *feet* equal to the check result divided by 10 (standing high jump) or divided by 5 (if you move at least 2 squares immediately before the jump). Either way, every five feet costs a square of movement.   

You can extend your arms a third of your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1-1/3 times your height.  

### Swim  
Make an Athletics check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed. If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you sink 1 square.  

The DC for the Swim check depends on the water (calm, rough or stormy).   

## Bluff (Cha)  
Your Bluff check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.  

### Feint

See the Feint action. 

### Create Diversion

See the Create Diversion action. 

## Diplomacy (Cha)  
When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Diplomacy check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring nations, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.  

## Dungeoneering (Wis)  
Knowledge of aberrations, caverns, oozes and spelunking.   

### Subterranean Hunting and Foraging  
Hunting and foraging takes one hour. On a successful check against DC 15, you find a day's worth of food and water for one creature. DC 25, you find a day's worth of food and water for five creatures.   

If you fail, you cannot attempt the check again for 24 hours.   

## Endure (Con)  

*Armor Check Penalty applies*

Harsh conditions or long exertions do not easily tire you. The GM might call for an Endure check when you:  

- March or labor for hours without rest  
- Go without sleep  
- Survive without food or water  
  
### Swim for Long Periods  
Each hour that you swim, you must make an Endure check (use the DC of the Athletics check you've been using, +2 for every hour). If you fail, you cannot swim any more and begin to sink.   

## Heal (Wis)  
A Heal check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.  

### Treat Ally

See the Treat Ally action. 

### Treat Disease

To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time the character makes an Endure or other check against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or their check result, whichever is higher.  

## History (Int)  
Your History check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.  

## Insight (Wis)

## Intimidate (Cha)  
When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make an Intimidate check.

The GM might ask you to make a Nature check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.  

### Wilderness Hunting and Foraging  
Hunting and foraging takes one hour. On a successful check against DC 15, you find a day's worth of food and water for one creature. DC 25, you find a day's worth of food and water for five creatures.    

If you fail, you cannot attempt the check again for 24 hours.   

### Soothe Beast  

To calm or soothe a natural beast, for example so you can ride it or because it has been startled, make a Nature check (hard DC, use the creature's level to calculate DC) as a standard action.  

### Teach an Animal a Trick  

You can teach a natural beast a specific trick, like attack, come, defend, down, fetch, guard, heel, perform, seek, stay, track or work. This may take an extended challenge to complete.   

## Perception (Wis)  
Your Perception check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.  

### Notice  

Most of the time, whether you notice something will be determined by the GM rolling against your passive Perception score. When you deliberately turn your attention to something, you can take a swift action to see if you notice something.   

### Search  

When you spend a minute or more searching an area, you can cover a 3 square by 3 square space.   

### Notice Hiding Creature  

Make an opposed Perception vs Stealth check. On a success, you know where they are and, unless they are hidden from you for some other reason (e.g. they are invisible), you can see them.   

## Religion (Int)  
Your Religion check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.  

## Sleight of Hand (Dex)  

*Armor Check Penalty applies*

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Sleight of Hand check. The GM might also call for a Sleight of Hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.  

### Disable Device  

Make a Sleight of Hand check as a standard action.   

If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it.   

### Open Lock  

Opening a lock is a standard action.   

### Pick Pockets  

If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a Sleight of Hand check against a hard DC (target's level, not player character's) to obtain it.   

If the check succeeds, you get the item. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but are not caught. If you fail by 5 or more, you have failed and the target catches you doing it.   

An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.  

## Stealth (Dex)  

*Armor Check Penalty applies*

Make a Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.  

### Hiding  
You can hide at the end of any action where you moved.   

When you try to hide, make a Stealth check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Perception check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.  

You must have superior cover or total concealment to hide from a target.   

An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.  

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you attack a creature or come out of hiding and approach a creature, it sees you at the end of that action. This means you still get combat advantage on that action.   

**Movement:** If you moved 3 squares or more, take a -5 penalty on the check to hide. If you took the Dash action, take a -10 penalty instead.   

While hidden, if you move 3 squares or more, you must make another Stealth check vs passive Perception score with a -5 penalty (-10 if running).   

**Passive Perception:** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Stealth check with that creature's passive Perception score (see Passive skills, above).   

## Streetsmarts (Cha)  

You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement.

You draw your power from strong emotions such as chivalry, honor and even fear. These act as energizers to your will and discipline, allowing them to act in conjunction to protect your from harm.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can manifest a shield of force which attaches to one of your hands, as a regular shield. You gain a +1 shield bonus to AC and Reflex defenses and your shield hand counts as if it was holding a light shield. You can dismiss the shield of force as a swift action. 

You count as having proficiency in light shields for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites. 

**Special:** Feats that apply to shields, like Toughened Shield or Bashing Shield, also apply to your shield of force. 

### Weapon Shard

You have learned how to focus your intense internal energies into a weapon, giving it shape and form according to your subconscious wishes.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can manifest a weapon shard (see stats below). Weapon shards are supernatural weapons (and thus do not belong to any weapon group), and can take almost any form, color and shape, all according to the wishes of the user. The user is always proficient with his weapon shard, and it is a one-handed weapon. For all intents and purposes, the weapon shard can be used to make all forms of melee attacks, as well as in conjunction with powers, or for the purpose of opportunity attacks.

Your weapon shard has a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls. This increases by +1 for every 5th level after 1st (+2 at 6th, +3 at 11th, etc.). On a critical hit, you do an additional 1d6 points of damage for every point of enhancement bonus.

# Equipment  

## Starting Equipment

First-level characters begin with 100 gold pieces to spend. Assume a character owns at least one outfit of normal clothes.  

Unless the GM provides otherwise, characters at higher levels start with one permanent magic item of their level +1, one permanent magic item of their level, one permanent magic item of their level -1, and gold pieces equivalent to the cost of a magic item of their level -1.  

## Coinage  

Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).  

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.  

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day or a night's rest in a poor inn.  

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars.   

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The platinum piece (pp) originates from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. A platinum piece is worth one hundred gold pieces.  

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.  

##### **Table – Exchange Rates**  

| Coin          | CP     | SP    | GP    | PP       |  
| ------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | -------- |  
| Copper (cp)   | 1      | 1/10  | 1/100 | 1/10,000 |  
| Silver (sp)   | 10     | 1     | 1/10  | 1/1,000  |  
| Gold (gp)     | 100    | 10    | 1     | 1/100    |  
| Platinum (pp) | 10,000 | 1,000 | 100   | 1        |  

## Selling Treasure  

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.  

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment:** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch one-fifth their cost when sold in a market.  

**Magic Items:** As a general rule, magic items fetch one-fifth their cost when sold in a market.  

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects:** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.  

**Trade Goods:** On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods – bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on – retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.  

## Armor  

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from cloth (lightly padded armor or regular clothing) to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into two categories: light armor and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.  

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.  

**Armor Proficiency:** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Reflex defense.   

**Armor Class (AC):** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.  

**Heavy Armor:** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. Do not add an ability modifier to your Armor Class while wearing heavy armor.   

**Armor Check Penalty:** If the Armor table shows “ACP”, the wearer suffers that penalty to skills that identify that they come with an Armor Check Penalty.  

**Shields:** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand.   

You can benefit from only one shield at a time.  

Light shields are strapped to your arm, you can still use your hand (e.g. to hold things or climb, but not to wield a weapon). Heavy shields are strapped to your arm and held in your hand, so you cannot use your hand for anything else.   

A shield's bonus applies to Armor Class and Reflex defenses.   

### Light Armor  

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  

**Cloth:** Cloth armor is padded armor, or just regular clothes or a robe.   

**Leather:** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.  

**Hide:** This armor consists of thick furs and pelts.   

### Heavy Armor  

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.  

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Intelligence or Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.  

**Chain Mail:** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows.   

**Scale:** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish.   

**Plate:** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.  

##### **Table – Armor and Shields**  

| Name          | Type  | Base AC | ACP  | Speed Penalty | Cost | Weight |  
| ------------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ------------- | ---- | ------ |  
| Cloth armor   | Light | 10      |      |               | 1    | 4 lb.  |  
| Leather armor | Light | 12      |      |               | 25   | 15 lb. |  
| Hide armor    | Light | 13      | -1   |               | 30   | 25 lb. |  
| Chainmail     | Heavy | 16      | -1   | -1            | 40   | 40 lb. |  
| Scale armor   | Heavy | 17      |      | -1            | 45   | 45 lb. |  
| Plate armor   | Heavy | 18      | -2   | -1            | 50   | 50 lb. |  

| Name         | Type   | Shield Bonus | ACP  | Speed Penalty | Cost  | Weight |  
| ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ---- | ------------- | ----- | ------ |  
| Light shield | Shield | +1           |      |               | 5 gp  | 6 lb.  |  
| Heavy shield | Shield | +2           | -2   |               | 10 gp | 15 lb. |  

## Weapons  

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's approach and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.  

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess.   

Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is typically used to attack a target in an adjacent square to you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance. Some melee weapons, called **thrown weapons**, can be used at a range. Other melee weapons, called **reach weapons**, are still held in the hands for an attack but can attack creatures further away than just adjacent squares.   

### Weapon Proficiency  

Your ancestry, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The three categories are **simple**, **martial** and **exotic**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Typically, proficiency in an exotic weapon only comes with specialized training.   

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add the weapon's proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add the proficiency bonus to the attack roll.  

### Character Size and Weapons

Small characters have trouble wielding two-handed weapons. Small characters cannot wield a two-handed weapon unless the weapon has the Small property.   

Medium characters who wield a one-handed weapon in two hands (other than one-handed weapons with the Side Weapon property) get a +1 bonus to damage.   

#### Variant: No Weapon Limitations for Small Characters  

While officially Small characters are limited in which weapons they can use, this can be frustrating for players and is not very important for game balance. GMs may prefer to let Small characters use any weapon they like.   

### Weapon Groups  

A weapon group describes the category that a weapon belongs to. Handaxes, battleaxes and greataxes all belong to the Axes category, for example.   

Weapon group has no rules of its own, but other powers and features might depend on the player character using a weapon from a particular group.   

- Axes  
- Bows  
- Crossbows  
- Slings  
- Maces and Clubs  
- Light Blades  
- Spears and Lances  
- Staffs  
- Heavy Blades  
- Picks and Hammers  
- Polearms  
- Flails and Chains  
  
### Weapon Properties  

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.  

**Execution #:** Reroll damage die results of # or lower. For example, if you roll 2d6 with an execution 1 weapon, reroll any d6s that come up 1 until they come up a different number.   

**Improved Critical:** *Level 1:* +1dW damage on a critical hit. *Level 11:* +2dW damage on a critical hit. *Level 21:* +3dW damage on a critical hit.   

**Loading:** You can use a weapon that requires loading with ammunition to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container takes either a free or swift action, as specified in the table. At the end of the encounter, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.  

*Loading (free):* It takes two hands to reload this weapon.  

*Loading (swift):* It takes two hands to reload this weapon. Because of the time required to load this weapon, after making a basic attack or attack power with this weapon, you must spend a swift action before attacking with it again.  

**Range:** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have a -2 penalty on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.  

**Reach:** This weapon adds 1 square to your reach when you attack with it. You can only flank or opportunity attack adjacent enemies, however.  

**Thrown:** You can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.  

*Thrown (light):* Use Dexterity for attack and damage rolls when you make a basic ranged attack with a heavy thrown weapon.   

*Thrown (heavy):* Use Strength instead of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls when you make a basic ranged attack with a heavy thrown weapon.   

**Two-Handed:** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.  

**Side Weapon:** You can hold a side weapon in your off hand. You can wield a one-handed weapon in one hand and a side weapon in your other. Each time you make a weapon attack (including a weapon power), you choose which weapon you attack with.   

**Small:** Small characters cannot use a two-handed weapon unless it also has the Small property.  

### Silvered Weapons  

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon, 10 crossbow bolts, 20 sling bullets or 30 arrows for 500 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.  

### Improvised Weapons  

An improvised weapon, including an unarmed strike, does 1d4 damage (one-handed) or 1d8 damage (two-handed), with no proficiency bonus on the attack.   

### Exotic Weapons  

Only a small number of special exotic weapons are presented here.   

**Garrote:** A simple wire, when used properly, can disable or kill an opponent in seconds.   

*Requirement:* You can only use a garrote against a target granting you combat advantage which is not aware of you. You can only use the garrote with a melee basic attack or specific powers which utilize the garrote.  

*Property:* When you hit with a garrote, you grapple the target. The target cannot speak while grappled. The target is dazed while the grapple is in effect. The target also suffers a -2 penalty to escape attempts.  

### Designing Your Own Weapons  

Only a small selection of weapons are presented.    

However, you can design your own melee weapons by selecting one of the generic options in square brackets, and assigning a Weapon Group to them.  

Certain weapons get an additional property or benefit based on their Group (if [group] is written under Properties):   

* **Maces and Clubs; Spears and Lances; Staffs:** Weapon die increases by one (see Increased Weapon Die table below).   
* **Light Blades; Heavy Blades:** Proficiency bonus increases by +1.  
* **Axes:** Execution 1.  
* **Picks and Hammers; Flails and Chains:** Improved Critical.   

You can design an exotic melee weapon by taking a martial weapon and adding another Group to it, along with the Group-based benefit or property listed above. 

For example, a khopesh could be a one-handed weapon in the Heavy Blades and Axes Groups, making it a proficiency +3, damage 1d8, Execution 1 weapon. A kukri could be a side weapon in the Light Blades and Heavy Blades Groups, making it a proficiency +4, damage 1d6 weapon.   

You can design an exotic ranged weapon by taking a martial weapon and increasing either its proficiency bonus by +1 or its damage die by one step.

## Focuses  

Most arcane, divine and natural powers, and some martial powers, have the Focus tag, meaning that they benefit from a magic focus if you use one while you use the power. Each power can only benefit from one magic focus at most.  

**Arcane Focus:** An arcane focus is a special item – typically an orb, rod, staff, wand or book, although a crystal or a pouch of spell components would also be thematically appropriate – designed to channel the power of arcane spells.  

A quarterstaff can be used as both an arcane focus and a weapon. A quarterstaff can be held in one hand when being used as a focus. A quarterstaff can either be enchanted as a focus or as a weapon, or separately as a weapon and as a focus -- in which case it costs as much as each item would separately, put together.   

Unless otherwise mentioned, arcane focuses require a hand to use.  

**Druidic Focus:** A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.  

Unless otherwise mentioned, druidic focuses require a hand to use.  

**Holy Symbol:** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic.  

Unless otherwise mentioned, a holy symbol does not require a hand to use. It is enough that you have it on your person (perhaps emblazoned on a shield or hung around your neck).  

**Martial Focus:** A martial focus is an item that inspires or reminds when seen or studied. It might be a short scroll describing a meditation that sharpens the mind for battle, or a book of strategies that can be reviewed quickly before bed, or a blunt sword that can be practiced with, or bindings wrapped around your hands while bareknuckle boxing, or a banner you carry on your back.   

Unless otherwise mentioned, a martial focus does not require a hand to use. It is enough that you have it on your person.

## Mounts and Vehicles  

A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down.

# Deities

Crusaders are usually sworn to the service of a particular god. Other characters may worship one or many gods - or none. A sample of gods of worshipped in the Outlaw Kingdoms (the default setting for the Orcus roleplaying game) is given below.   

## Chalavar  

The Glutton  
 **Symbol:** A knife on an empty plate  
 **Portfolio:** Food, feasting, prosperity  
 **Favored Weapon:** Dagger  

A happy and boastful god, Chalavar (CHAL-uh-var) is a welcome visitor to any meal or business gathering, as he makes the food safe and incredibly tasty and the dealings profitable for all involved. Worshipped by people who work with food or conduct trade, Chalavar is a popular deity despite having few actual crusaders. He is shown as a round, pleasant-faced man wearing expensive rings, necklaces, and a jeweled cylindrical hat. He knows the best use for any animal, from the work it is suited for to the other food it complements.  

He also knows the medicinal and culinary use for every plant. His rare temples are popular among adventurers, as Chalavar’s priests love examining the carcasses of strange monsters to see what good can be made of them— for they study the art of cooking with as much ardor as their god.  

Chalavar’s worshippers have many holidays, including the birthdays of famous priests or local nobles, seasonal occurrences, and historical events. These holidays always involve feasting.Worshippers even throw feasts on the holy days of other faiths, knowing that Chalavar gets his thanks whenever someone enjoys a good meal. It is considered bad form to not throw a feast on your own birthday, and wealthier followers of Chalavar show off their prosperity and generosity by holding great birth-feasts with hundreds of guests. Common folk praise Chalavar’s name whenever a meal is extra good or a business deal turns out particularly well.  

## Enoran  

The Old Spirit  
 **Symbol:** Sun setting behind a leafless tree  
 **Portfolio:** Death, the ending of things, mourning  
 **Favored Weapon:** Quarterstaff  

Enoran (EN-or-an) is a god spoken of only rarely, for he represents death from age, as well as the aging and decay of the world over time. He also comforts those who have suffered loss, whether the loss of a family member or the death of a treasured tree. A minor aspect of his faith involves the enactment of vengeance, although he has emphasized this less and less over the centuries.  

He is a sad, quiet deity, weary from carrying on his shoulders the weight of generations of sorrow and death. He is depicted as an impossibly old elf with gray hair and a wrinkled face. Enoran is said to keep a book of names of all the dead, written in his own blood.  

Enoran’s faith has no true holidays, though worshippers sing songs of joy every time someone comes back from the dead. Each day they light black candles in the name of those who died on that day. They fast for the last three days of the year, breaking their fast on the first sunrise of the new year.  

Even devout worshippers rarely speak of Enoran except at funerals and in the wake of battles.  

## Korven  

The Defending Blade  
 **Symbol:** A well-notched short sword  
 **Portfolio:** Defensive tactics, protection, vigilance, Halfling soldiers  
 **Favored Weapon:** Short sword  

A serious-minded deity, Korven (KOR-ven) protects all common folk and inspires them to defend their homes and families when beset by hostile creatures. He and his followers take a more reactive than proactive stance; if people are not threatened, he seems content to remain quiet and fortify, but when people are in danger he is ready to lead them to victory. His followers study traps and fortifications as well as applications of direct force. Under their tutelage even a simple caravan wagon can become a mobile fortress.  

He is rarely depicted, but when he is it is always as a fully-mailed halfling warrior with a battered short sword and metal shield, eyes showing determination from within an open-faced helmet.  

Korven is actually the fourth deity to hold this office. As each fell, their most faithful follower was deified. The cycle of death and renewal gives its current holder an acceptance of death and a tendency toward martyrdom, as he knows his legacy and duties will carry on.  

Korven’s followers celebrate (in somber fashion) the anniversaries of great battles where good people emerged victorious, and they light candles for heroes lost in battle while defending others. Lay people pray to him for protection at the start of a journey and before retiring for the evening, asking for safe travel and safe rest.  

## Larhoon  

The Bloodhunger  
 **Symbol:** Bloody-topped skull  
 **Portfolio:** Killing, murder  
 **Favored Weapon:** Club  

Larhoon (lar-HOON) is an unrelenting, violent deity, said to have sprung from the corpse of the just-murdered god of death, bristling with teeth and horns. He loves death in all its forms, from slow torture to quick disintegration. It is said that Larhoon never sleeps, that he will never rest as long as one creature still remains alive. Larhoon is no fan of the undead, either, and relishes destroying them nearly as much as he does living creatures. He is depicted as a gray-skinned muscular humanoid creature with spines and horns protruding in all places; his only raiment is a belt made of bloody skulls.  

Larhoon spends much of his time alone, searching for new things to kill. He welcomes challenges to his power and has drunk the blood of many godlings and great heroes who thought to slay him.  

Larhoon’s followers celebrate whenever there is a public death (such as an execution), feast on the anniversaries of battles in which many fell, and sacrifice animals to honor the names of famous assassins, murderers, and warlords. His faith consists of many small cults with no central hierarchy. Larhoon’s name has become a curse among the common folk. In less-than-orderly places, criminals are sacrificed to him in hopes of keeping his attention away from others in the community.  

## Kurzana  

The Builder  
 **Symbol:** Carpenter’s hammer with a spider symbol  
 **Portfolio:** Construction, building, weaving, engineering  
 **Favored Weapon:** Hammer  

Kurzana (kur-ZAH-nuh) is an old deity that has changed over time as the people of the world developed their knowledge of building. Originally a goddess of caverns, she took on the mantle of shelters when intelligent creatures began building homes for themselves, and eventually reached her current state, watching over all kinds of building, whether homes, temples, or other structures in a community. She opposes deities of destruction and those that dislike or harm civilization (such as gods of plague). She is depicted as a woman with stony skin, wearing a simple gown and bearing a hammer with a spider on it. Her faith considers killing normal spiders, her chosen animal, bad luck; monstrous spiders that actually constitute a threat are an exception. All building styles intrigue her, and she allies with likeminded deities. Although willing to talk endlessly about engineering, Kurzana remains otherwise a distant deity, having no close friendships with deities who do not share her specialized interests.  

Kurzana’s followers have few holidays, although they do note the dates on which the construction of great buildings began or ended. Although not a particularly martial faith, her priests often move to small communities to establish temples that double as sturdy fortresses, which they open to the entire community when the settlement is threatened. Her priests tend to be scholars in one building style, and sensible folk consult with a member of the church before planning any construction expected to last more than a year. Common folk pray to Kurzana during storms to keep their homes safe and at the groundbreaking of new buildings to bless those within.  

## Kain  

The Black Lord  
 **Symbol:** Horizontal mailed fist  
 **Portfolio:** Tyranny, rulership  
 **Favored Weapon:** Spear  

Kain (KAYN) is a megalomaniacal deity who believes that only the strong are fit to rule, and that he is destined to rule the world and all of the other gods. He makes elaborate plans and spends years watching them unfold, becoming frustrated when the actions of chaotic beings and other meddlers interfere with his plots. His brother is Vogg, a deity of random destruction and one of his frequent opponents, although the two cannot perceive each other directly or be affected by each others’ direct actions. While he hates the forces of good that interfere with his works, he saves his greatest wrath for chaotic fiends, who give no regard to his orders and (in his words) “give evil a bad name.” He is shown as a man with midnight-black skin and glowing eyes, wearing a noble’s clothing of simple cut and dark colors. His left arm is encased in black metallic armor, from which he can pull an iron spear as often as he likes.  

Kain’s church celebrates the anniversaries of great priests’ and tyrants’ birthdays, the first day of every month, and every new moon. These celebrations are more an affirmation of faith in and loyalty to the Black Lord than episodes of revelry. The sacrifice of dissidents or enemies of the church accompanies the rites whenever possible. Few common folk worship Kain, although in places where he holds much political power he is respected for his ability to keep bandits and raiding monsters away. His rule is otherwise harsh.  

## Luna  

 **Symbol:** Three crescent moons arranged in a line  
 **Portfolio:** The moon, feminine power, non-evil lycanthropes  
 **Favored Weapon:** Chakram  

A very old goddess, Luna predates current civilizations. A powerful force for the protection and power of women, her strength has waxed and waned over the centuries. Where the sun is hot and aggressive in its light, the moon remains cool and gentle. She prefers peace to war, and kind words to loud speech, but when someone threatens her charges, she can tear apart her foes with the ferocity of a she-bear defending her cubs. She is also the patron goddess of lycanthropes, and her faith teaches that her light blesses good lycanthropes. Conversely, Luna teaches that evil lycanthropes are corruptions of her gifts to mortals; her followers hunt them down to either cure or kill. She is always shown as a woman with white eyes, dark hair, and a crescent symbol on her forehead, although other details vary. Dogs, wolves, and owls are her sacred animals.  

Luna’s church holds a small ceremony on the first day of each new, full, and quarter moon. Lunar eclipses always call for prayer vigils until the moon appears again, while solar eclipses are sacred events to be celebrated publicly, enjoying the night during the day. Women hold most positions of power in her church, and a disproportionate number of her crusaders are female, but her church neither shuns nor marginalizes men. Common folk invoke Luna’s name at weddings to bless the bride and keep her safe in her husband’s house, at childbirth to guard the expectant mother’s health, and at any time when journeys must be made at night.  

## Shehaan  

Goddess of the Mists, the Mist Goddess  
 **Symbol:** A moon (crescent or full) behind a cloud of mist  
 **Portfolio:** Mist, isolation, concealment  
 **Favored Weapon:** Quarterstaff  

Shehaan (shay-HON) is a reclusive goddess, almost forgotten. Although this should mean her power is dwindling, she draws strength from her great solitude and uses it to protect her faithful. She avoids direct confrontation, preferring to redirect an opponent’s attention, confuse the minds of her enemies, and retreat when victory is not certain. She is shown as an elven woman with wet hair and pale skin, dressed in a gossamer robe or a concealing cloak.  

Like the moon, Shehaan changes. On nights when the moon is new she becomes rather wild, willing to take risks and even reveal her presence when she normally would remain hidden. This change does not affect the abilities of her worshippers, although they, too, seem more willing to take risks on these days.  

Solar eclipses are holy days to the faithful, when her followers given up to the goddess unusual plants and fruits as sacrifices. They go into hiding whenever a lunar eclipse occurs; during these times, which they call the “Night of Madness,” they lose all spellcasting ability, as their goddess goes truly mad and forgets her worshippers entirely. Shehaan always regrets these lapses and apologetically pays closer attention to her followers in the weeks following such an event.  

Where she is worshipped, the common folk pray to her to keep them hidden from the eyes of their enemies and to bring needed rain.  

## Thalander  

Quickheart, Many-Father  
 **Symbol:** White cat surrounded by a red glow  
 **Portfolio:** Vitality, fertility, strength  
 **Favored Weapon:** Longsword  

The boisterous and extroverted Thalander (tha-LANder) embodies the principles of life, survival, and perpetuation of life. Where he walks, plants sprout and animals spring up out of nothing. When he laughs, the air is filled with beautiful birds and insects. Thalander, the greatest foe of the undead, is often depicted blasting them out of existence with great beams of life energy from his hands. Like the cat of his symbol, Thalander has a roving eye and woos many people, whether deity, celestial, or mortal. He has many offspring, some of whom carry his divine blood more strongly than others. Thalander himself is a fair-skinned, redheaded man with a lean but strong build; he is usually shown barefoot, wearing cloth breeches and little else. In some of the more decadent cities his temples double as palaces devoted to the flesh, for his faith teaches that passion and childbirth are needed to remain vital and alive.  

The spring equinox is a day of great celebration, marking the height of Thalander’s power, and worshippers hold weekly feasts throughout the entire spring season. The autumn equinox is their only somber holiday, a remembrance of people met and lives shared in the past growing season, ending on a high note as they look forward to the breaking of winter. Common folk pray to Thalander to bring healthy crops and bless marriages with an abundance of children. They invoke his name at the presentation of a new child to the community, in hopes of ensuring a long and healthy life.  

## Thoin  

The Keeper, the Silent Pick  
 **Symbol:** A gem within a mountain  
 **Portfolio:** Mines, secrets under the earth  
 **Favored Weapon:** Pick  

Thoin (THOH-in) the Keeper is a silent deity of the rewards waiting underground. Not content to dig and sift for treasures, Thoin feels that his followers have a birthright to the Underdeep that authorises them to eliminate all heretics underground so their lesser hands will not profane the treasures with unskilled workmanship. Thoin’s particular hatred is for metal- and gem-eating monsters such as rust monsters, xorn, and metal-addicted delvers.  

Thoin is shown as a long-bearded dwarf made of stone, bearing a great pick or pickaxe, eyes and mouth glowing like sparkling gems or fresh lava. He never speaks, but seems amenable to the company of other earth deities who respect his dogma. His faithful take particular vengeance against thieves, burning them to death with molten rock.  

Followers of Thoin celebrate upon finding a vein of new ore, especially if that ore is mithral or adamantine. They hold weeklong wakes whenever a king or high priest dies and his followers never bury their dead with treasures—they see that as a waste of good metal and an affront to the deceased, as it presumes them incapable of looking for new treasures in the afterlife. Thoin’s churches display their wealth openly as a display of the god’s power and generosity. A temple of Thoin doubles as an armory and fortress, as followers use it as a launching point for attacks on pagan miners and for defense against raiders. Common people pray to Thoin after hard work to find rewards and before battles waged to gain or protect valuable objects.  

## Vaath  

The Laugher  
 **Symbol:** A laughing mouth within a wavy circle  
 **Portfolio:** Humor, irony  
 **Favored Weapon:** Rapier  

Vaath (VOTH) is a well-traveled deity, always on the run from her last escapade. She represents the ability to laugh at frightening or impossible situations as well as the more traditional aspects of humor and irony. She dislikes older, staid deities, preferring to shake things up a bit and see what laughter there is to discover in the world. Depictions of her vary, but she is usually shown as a humanoid woman with a large grin and bright teeth (although she is sometimes shown as a fox or even a man). She trained herself to run faster than the wind, hold her breath for nine days, and speak out of both sides of her mouth; three skills she needed to pull off an elaborate joke on the gods of storms, fire, and cities. She loves recruiting worshippers from serious or wrathful deities just to see the reaction of her divine opponents.  

Vaath’s worshippers pray on a different schedule from month to month, chosen by the deity and revealed at the last minute. Her followers are great fans of All Fool’s Day, where they make up almost unbelievable stories and try to get as many people as possible to fall for them. They honor the birthdays of local nobles with roasts and caricatures, and often celebrate somber holidays of other faiths with loud songs, indecent jokes, and extravagant pranks. Because of these habits, many priests of Vaath use aliases when going about the goddess’ work or use disguises or magic to pretend to worship other deities in order to prevent retaliation. Common people invoke her name in times of good cheer and when things go wrong, in hopes of seeing a more positive side—such as the church’s fable of the plowman’s ox that hurt its leg on a stone, under which lay a nugget of gold.  

## Valkon  

The Sky Lord  
 **Symbol:** Cloud with a lightning bolt  
 **Portfolio:** Air, wind, clouds, ordered nature of the heavens  
 **Favored Weapon:** Longbow  

Valkon (VAL-kahn) is the master of the air and heavens, from the stars to coastal breezes and everything in between. An active and aggressive deity, he loathes chaos, unpredictability, and ancient magical weapons of war that promote those things. This puts him at odds with most other weather deities, who tend to be more carefree and capricious. His celestial messengers are birds, and his temples often use birds to carry messages or spy on their enemies. Valkon enjoys archery and believes it to be a superior form of warcraft to melee fighting. In artwork he is depicted as a tall winged man, lithe but strong, bearing a longbow and having close-cropped fair hair.  

Valkon’s worshippers celebrate the equinoxes and solstices as holy days, as well as the first rainfall in spring and the first snowfall in autumn or winter. Common folk pray to him to bring needed rains or fend off approaching storms, which are always considered to be the work of rival weather gods.  

## Vogg  

The Firelord  
 **Symbol:** An eye surrounded by flame  
 **Portfolio:** Wildfire, destruction, randomness  
 **Favored Weapon:** Mace  

Vogg (VOG) is the embodiment of random destruction. Although he is as intelligent as his brother Kain, he only uses his mind to think up ways to break things faster, louder, and hotter. He is more than content to run about covered in flames of his own creation, setting afire anything he touches or even gazes at for too long.  

He is shown as a humanoid (the type varies by artist and cult) with his skin blackened by great heat, hair of flame, and carrying a mace made of solid fire. Vogg doesn’t really hate anything as much as he is curious about how well and how quickly he can destroy it. He becomes angry when someone places in his way obstacles that he cannot harm, and he becomes livid when someone quenches a fire he sets or dares to try calming him. Vogg would be a more powerful deity if he didn’t have the habit of answering some invocations with blasts of violent fire, which tends to reduce his number of worshippers. He is a friend to fire elementals and tolerates efreet and other fiery creatures.  

Vogg’s worshippers care little for scheduled holidays, but revel in the presence of any great fire, whether naturally occurring or deliberately set. They’re not above setting a fire for the excuse to celebrate. Though most of his followers are too simpleminded to appreciate the destruction of particularly valuable things (such as sacred groves, historic buildings, and so on), they do like watching temples to protective or water deities burn to ash. On the hottest day of the year, members of the church summon as many fire elementals as possible and send them running about, burning whatever they see. In idle times, cult cells are likely to self-destruct, as rival priests set each other on fire as fanatical offerings to their obsessive deity.  

## Yaheine  

The Sword Maiden  
 **Symbol:** Kite shield with a sunburst  
 **Portfolio:** Protection, valor, honor  
 **Favored Weapon:** Bastard sword  

Daughter of the sun god, Yaheine (ya-HEEN) is the faithful guardian, protector of the innocent, and champion of good. Channeling the power of her father, Yaheine strikes out at all evil in her path, making places safe for decent folk. She cannot abide fiends or the undead, and hunts necromancers and demonologists without mercy. She is shown as a tall woman bearing a flashing bastard sword and clad in shining metal armor, her gold hair unbound in a storm about her face like solar flames. When age catches up with her crusaders, they usually take up a leadership role in a community, administering fair law and keeping the peace, ready to bear arms whenever evil raises its head. Her followers respect those who worship the sun god, and the two closely allied churches often share space in the same temple.  

Yaheine’s crusaders pray for their spells at dawn when the leading edge of the sun first becomes visible. Their holy days are the summer solstice and midwinter— said to be the time of year when the sun god’s priests received word that his daughter had been born and would become a champion for all good in the world. Common folk pray to her for fairness in all things, as well as protection in unsafe places. Her name is used to seal oaths as a promise of good intent.

# Appendices  

## Appendix A: Powers Available by Level  

The following table shows how many powers and of which levels a character is entitled to, based on the character's level. A character can always choose a lower-level power (of the same frequency, e.g. a level 3 encounter attack power instead of a level 7 encounter attack power) in place of a higher-level one.  

“(P)” indicates that the power comes from a prestige path. “(E)” indicates that the power comes from an epic path.
