# Ancestries  

## Ancestry Traits  

The description of each ancestry includes traits that are common to members of that ancestry. The following entries appear among the traits of most ancestries.  

### Ability Score Increase(s)  

Every ancestry increases one or more of a character's ability scores.  

### Size  

Characters of most ancestries are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few ancestries are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall).   

Small characters have trouble wielding two-handed weapons. Small characters cannot wield a two-handed weapon unless the weapon has the Small property.   

Medium characters who wield a one-handed weapon in two hands (other than one-handed weapons with the Side Weapon property) get a +1 bonus to damage.   

### Speed  

Your speed determines how far you can move.  

### Languages  

By virtue of your ancestry, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.  

## Human  

### Human Traits  

It's hard to make generalizations about humans.  

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall.   

Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Giant curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.  

***Ability Score Increases:***   

* +2 to one ability score of your choice  
  

***Size:*** Your size is Medium.  

***Speed:*** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.  

***Languages:*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

***Hardy Stock:*** +1 ancestry bonus to Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses.   

***Human Power:*** You have a third level 1 at-will attack power from your class.   

### Variant: True Grit  

Instead of giving humans a third level 1 at-will attack power from their class, GMs may want to offer them the *true grit* power instead - especially if they are taking a class that does not have at-will attack powers. However, GMs should note that *true grit* is unusually powerful for an ancestry power and it overlaps with the elf's *careful focus* power.  

***Human Power:*** You have the *true grit* power.  

> #### True Grit  
> **Encounter** **No Action**  
> **Human Utility Ancestry**     
> **Self**   
> **Trigger:**  You fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll  
> **Effect:** Add a +4 Ancestry bonus to the roll/throw.

# Designing Your Own Ancestries  

While Orcus only comes with a handful of ancestries by default, you can design your own by following the steps below.   

## Ability Score Increases  

Pick three ability scores. The ancestry grants +2 to one of the ability scores, and +2 to the player's choice of the other two ability scores.    

## Skill Bonuses  

Pick two skills. The ancestry grants a +2 ancestry bonus to each skill   

## Size, Speed  

By default, ancestries are Medium with a speed of 6. Other options include:  

* Small, speed 6.   
* Small, speed 5.  
* Medium, speed 5, your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.  
  
## Language  

Common, plus one or two others that make sense.   

## Color Traits  

Choose none, or as many as you like. Adding a couple of color traits to an ancestry can be a way to compensate for underwhelming traits in other areas, like a speed of 5 or one of the weaker minor traits.   

* **Low-Light Vision:** You can see in dim light as if it were bright light.  
* **Shake Off X:** +5 ancestry bonus on saving throws against powers and effects with the Poison, Psychic, Fear, Illusion or Charm tag.   
* **Fey Ancestry:** You count as a fey creature for all purposes.  
* **Undead Ancestry:** You count as an undead creature for all purposes.  
* **Trance:** You don't need to sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. Your 4-hour trance has the same effect as a 6-hour long rest.  
* **Reptile Ancestry:** You count as a reptile creature for all purposes.  
* **Hold Breath:** +5 ancestry bonus to Endure checks to hold your breath.  
* **Swamp Stride:** Mud, marsh and shallows are not difficult terrain for you.  
* **Ice Stride:** Ice, snow or slurry are not difficult terrain for you.  
* **Stone Stride:** Broken ground, uneven stone or rubble are not difficult terrain for you.  
* **Woodland Stride:** Shrubbery, trees or plants are not difficult terrain for you.  
* **Web Stride:** Webs, like those from a spider, are not difficult terrain for you.  
  
## Minor Traits  

By default, each ancestry gets two.   

* **X Weapon Proficiency:** You have proficiency with martial weapons in a particular weapon group.   
* **Light Shield Proficiency:** You have proficiency with light shields.  
* **Unmoved:** Reduce any unwilling movement you are subject to by 1 square. When you would fall prone as the result of an attack, make a saving throw-on a success, you do not fall.   
* **X Guidance:** Allies within 10 receive a +1 ancestry bonus to a particular skill.   
* **Focus Proficiency:** You have proficiency with orbs, staffs and wands.   
* **Skill Training:** You are trained in an extra skill of your choice.  
* **Combined Heritage:** For the purpose of taking feats, you count as two ancestries of your choice.

* **Relentless Endurance (1/encounter):** When you are staggered, gain temporary HP equal to your level.    
* **Resistance to X:** Resistance to one or two types of damage 5 + half your level.  
* **Burrower:** You have a burrow speed of 1 square. Your burrow cannot extend too far or it risks caving in; you must double back to the surface after burrowing for 5 squares.   
* **Just Keep Going:** When you make Endure checks as part of a group check or extended challenge, or to Aid Another, roll twice and take the higher result.   
* **Under-Developed Wings:** You have a fly speed of 6, but you fall at the end of your turn and your maximum altitude is 1.   
* **Go for the Jugular:** +1 ancestry bonus on attacks against staggered enemies.   
* **Shared Mind:** Telepathy 5.  
* **Minor Magics:** You know one power from the Cantrips discipline.    
  
## Power  

Each ancestry also gets one power.

## Variant: No Weapon Limitations for Small Characters  

While officially Small characters are limited in which weapons they can use, this can be frustrating for players and is not very important for game balance. GMs may prefer to let Small characters use any weapon they like.   


# Skills  

A skill check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for a skill check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.  

**Using Skills**: To make a skill check, roll:  

**1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = +5 if you are trained in the skill + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)**  

This roll works just like an attack roll - the higher the roll, the better. Either you’re trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you’re trying to beat another character’s check result.  

**Ability Modifier**: The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill’s key ability (the ability associated with the skill’s use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.  

**Miscellaneous Modifiers**: Miscellaneous modifiers include ancestry bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.  

## Using Skills  

When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well they do. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.  

Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise they would fail.  

## Skill Checks  

A skill check takes into account a character’s training (skill training), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account their ancestry's knack for doing certain things (ancestry bonus) or what armor they are wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things.  

To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character’s skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character’s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill’s key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including ancestry bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.  

### Difficulty Class  

Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.  

**Table - Recommended Difficulty Classes by Level**  

| Level | Easy | Moderate | Hard |  
|-------|------|----------|------|  
| 1     | 8    | 12       | 18   |  
| 2     | 9    | 13       | 19   |  
| 3     | 9    | 14       | 20   |  
| 4     | 10   | 14       | 21   |  
| 5     | 10   | 15       | 22   |  
| 6     | 11   | 16       | 22   |  
| 7     | 11   | 16       | 23   |  
| 8     | 12   | 17       | 24   |  
| 9     | 12   | 18       | 25   |  
| 10    | 13   | 19       | 26   |  
| 11    | 13   | 19       | 26   |  
| 12    | 14   | 20       | 27   |  
| 13    | 14   | 21       | 28   |  
| 14    | 15   | 21       | 29   |  
| 15    | 15   | 22       | 30   |  
| 16    | 16   | 23       | 30   |  
| 17    | 16   | 23       | 31   |  
| 18    | 17   | 24       | 32   |  
| 19    | 17   | 25       | 33   |  
| 20    | 18   | 26       | 34   |  
| 21    | 18   | 26       | 34   |  
| 22    | 19   | 27       | 35   |  
| 23    | 19   | 28       | 36   |  
| 24    | 20   | 28       | 37   |  
| 25    | 20   | 29       | 38   |  
| 26    | 21   | 30       | 38   |  
| 27    | 21   | 30       | 39   |  
| 28    | 22   | 31       | 40   |  
| 29    | 22   | 32       | 41   |  
| 30    | 23   | 33       | 42   |  

### Opposed Checks  

An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.  

### Trying Again  

In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.  

### Untrained Skill Checks  

Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill they do not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn’t have a skill training bonus added. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill’s key ability, are applied to the check.  

Certain uses of some skills are only available to someone who is trained in that skill.  

### Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions  

Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.  

The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.  

1.  Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.  
2.  Give the skill user a –2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.  
3.  Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.  
4.  Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.  

Conditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.  

### Time and Skill Checks  

Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions or move actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action. These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.  

### Checks without Rolls  

A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.  

**Taking 10**: When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure - you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help.  

**Ability Checks**: The normal take 10 rules apply for ability checks.  

**Passive Checks**: A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.  

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:  

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check  

The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.  

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and training in Perception, they have a passive Perception score of 17.  

## Combining Skill Attempts  

When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.  

### Group Checks  

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.  

To make a group check, everyone in the group makes the skill check (or, in rare cases, the ability check). If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.  

Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a Nature group check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.  

### Aid Another  

You can help another character achieve success on their skill or ability check by making the same kind of check in a cooperative effort. The DC is 10 + half the level of the ally you are aiding. If you succeed, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to their check. If you fail, the character you are helping gets a -1 penalty to their check.   

In many cases, a character’s help won’t be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.  

In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can’t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn’t achieve alone.  

## Ability Checks  

Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you’re making an untrained skill check.  

In some cases, what is needed is a straight test of one’s ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn’t make a height check to see who is taller, you don’t make a Strength check to see who is stronger.  

## Extended Challenges  

With most skill checks, a single die roll immediately determines whether or not a character succeeds. If a character wants to jump across a chasm or recall a specific piece of information, his success or failure is apparent after a single check.  

For complicated and time-consuming tasks (such as disabling a very complex trap, crafting a powerful artifact or researching an obscure bit of knowledge), or at times when the Game Master wants to build tension and suspense, an extended challenge might be called for. An extended challenge is a series of interconnected skill checks, in which the player characters try to succeed on some number of checks before failing three checks, in order to achieve an objective.   

In such a case, a specific number of successful skill checks must be achieved to complete the task. The complexity of the task is reflected in the number of successful rolls required to complete the task, and the maximum number of failed rolls that can occur before the attempt fails. In most cases, one or two failed rolls does not mean that an extended challenge has failed, but if three failed rolls occur before the character makes the required number of successful rolls, the attempt fails. Although three failures is a common baseline, Game Masters are encouraged to change the number if the situation warrants it.  

Extended challenges allow the Game Master to build suspense in critical situations, add tension to multiple-round tasks during combat, enhance special adventure-specific tasks, and resolve complex activities more quickly.  

Succeeding or failing the challenge typically determines whether achieving the objective comes at a cost, not whether the objective is achieved. In some cases, each success represents progress towards the objective, and failing the challenge just means missing out on all the available progress.   

Every extended challenge has a level, which determines the check DCs (different skills may attract Easy, Moderate or Hard DCs as appropriate for that level). Usually the level is set to the level of the PCs. Typically group checks use the Easy DC, the first check with a particular skill uses the Moderate DC and subsequent checks with that skill use the Hard DC.   

Whether they succeed or fail, PCs earn the XP specified for the extended challenge, often equivalent to each PC defeating one standard monster of that level.   

All PCs should participate, but not necessarily by making skill checks. They can also Aid Another to assist an ally's check. A failed Aid Another check does not count as a failure.   

Some special rules may apply to a particular challenge, e.g.:   
* on a failed challenge, each PC loses a recovery   
* certain skills can only be attempted once or twice   
* use of an encounter or daily power can serve as a success by itself   
* use of a consumable item or payment of gold pieces can serve as a success by itself   
* the outcome depends on which specific skills were used   
* a successful check removes a failure instead of adding a success  
* a successful check adds a bonus or reroll to another check instead of adding a success  
* the challenge has multiple stages, with different checks and outcomes in each one   
* missing a check DC causes a complication rather than a failure that counts towards the three   
* the threshold is greater or fewer than three failures  
* the challenge takes place during a combat (only 4-6 successes should be required in this case, replacing 1-2 standard monsters)  
  
# Skill Descriptions   

This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.  

Here is the format for skill descriptions.  

## Skill Name  

The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.  

**Key Ability**: The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check.   

**Example Uses**: Suggestions for how the skill can be used.   

**Trained Only**: If this notation is included for an example use, you must be trained in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used untrained.   

**Armor Check Penalty**: If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.  

The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other types of information:  

## Skills  
* Acrobatics (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)  
* Arcana (Int)  
* Athletics (Str, Armor Check Penalty)  
* Bluff (Cha)  
* Diplomacy (Cha)  
* Dungeoneering (Wis)   
* Endure (Con, Armor Check Penalty)  
* Heal (Wis)  
* History (Int)  
* Insight (Wis)

### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities  

Normally, a set ability modifier applies to all checks with a particular skill. For example, Athletics checks add your Strength modifier.   

In some situations, though, a different ability might reasonably apply. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a different modifier.   

### Contests  
Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In contests like these, the outcome is determined by an opposed check.  

An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher check modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.  

### Knowledge  
Five skills - Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Nature and Religion - can be used to test a character's knowledge about a particular topic. General knowledge should have an Easy DC, knowledge that is based on specialization in a field a Moderate DC and obscure, hidden or secret knowledge a Hard DC.   

#### Monster Knowledge  

To test what you know about a monster, make a skill check against a Moderate DC (using the level of the monster, not the player character, to determine the DC). On a success, you learn:   

* name  
* ancestry  
* type  
* tags  
* standard temperament   
  

If you also beat the Hard DC, you also learn:  
* its powers  
* its resistances  
* its vulnerabilities   
  

Which skill to use?   
* Use Arcana for elemental and fey creatures, and creatures with the construct or shadow tag.  
* Use Dungeoneering for aberration creatures.   
* Use Religion for outsider creatures, and creatures with the undead tag.  
* Use Nature for natural creatures.  
  
## Acrobatics (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)  
Acrobatics covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for an Acrobatics check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.  

### Balance  
You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can’t move for the rest of the action. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface.  

_Being Attacked while Balancing_: If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Acrobatics check against the same DC to remain standing.  

### Escape Restraints  

Your Acrobatics check is opposed by a DC based on the type of restraint. It takes five minutes, or a standard action if you take a -10 penalty on the check. If you fail the check, you can only try again if someone is in a position to assist you with Aid Another.   

### Escape a Grapple  

See the Escape action.   

### Fall with Style (Trained Only)  
Make an Acrobatics check while falling to reduce damage. You take less damage equal to half the Acrobatics check result (for example, if your result is 23, you take 11 less damage). If you take no damage, you land on your feet (i.e., not prone).  

## Arcana (Int)  
Your Arcana check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.  

### Detect Magic (Trained Only)  
You sense the presence of magic.  

#### Identify Persistant Power  

Make an Arcana check against a power you can see with the Conjuration, Summon or Zone tags (DC 15 + 1/2 power's level). On a success, you learn the power's name, tags and tradition. On a failure, you must take a short rest before trying to identify that particular power again.   

#### Identify Magical Things  

Make an Arcana check against an environmental magical effect or the results of an incantation (hard DC). On a success, you identify the name of the phenomenon, any tags it might have or tradition it comes from, and its general purpose. If it is the result of an incantation, you learn the incantation's names and the basics of its effects. On a failure, you must take a long rest before trying to identify that particular thing again.   

#### Sense Magic  

As a standard action, you attempt to sense the presence of magic within 5 + your level squares.   

For each magical thing in range:   

* If its level is your level -5 or less, you automatically learn its tradition and location.   
* If its level is greater than your level -5, make an Arcana check (hard DC) to learn its tradition and location.   
  
## Athletics (Str, Armor Check Penalty)  
Athletics covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:  

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.  
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.  
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.  
  
### Climb  
With a successful Athletics check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at half your normal speed.   

An Athletics check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.  

Each square climbed costs one extra square of movement (so if you have a speed of 6, with a move action you can climb 3).   

Any time you take damage while climbing, make an Athletics check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.  

_Catching Yourself When Falling_: It’s difficult to catch yourself while falling. Make an Athletics check (DC = wall’s DC + 5) to do so.   

### Escape a Grapple  

See the Escape action.   

### Jump  

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.  

***Long Jump:*** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of *squares* equal to the check result divided by 10 (standing long jump) or divided by 5 (if you move at least 2 squares immediately before the jump). If the jump is successful, you land in the square beyond the square you jumped over.   

Either way, each square you clear on the jump costs a square of movement.  

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. If you clear at least one square, the vertical height of your jump is 2 feet + the number of squares you could clear. E.g. if your jump could clear a 4-square gap, the vertical height is 6 feet.   

***High Jump:*** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of *feet* equal to the check result divided by 10 (standing high jump) or divided by 5 (if you move at least 2 squares immediately before the jump). Either way, every five feet costs a square of movement.   

You can extend your arms a third of your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1-1/3 times your height.  

### Swim  
Make an Athletics check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed. If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you sink 1 square.  

The DC for the Swim check depends on the water (calm, rough or stormy).   

## Bluff (Cha)  
Your Bluff check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.  

The Feint and Create Diversion actions use the Bluff skill. 

## Diplomacy (Cha)  
When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Diplomacy check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring nations, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.  

## Dungeoneering (Wis)  
Knowledge of aberrations, caverns, oozes and spelunking.   

### Subterranean Hunting and Foraging  
Hunting and foraging takes one hour. On a successful check against DC 15, you find a day's worth of food and water for one creature. DC 25, you find a day's worth of food and water for five creatures.   

If you fail, you cannot attempt the check again for 24 hours.   

## Endure (Con, Armor Check Penalty)  

Harsh conditions or long exertions do not easily tire you. The GM might call for an Endure check when you:  

- March or labor for hours without rest  
- Go without sleep  
- Survive without food or water  
  
### Swim for Long Periods  
Each hour that you swim, you must make an Endurance check (use the DC of the Athletics check you've been using, +2 for every hour). If you fail, you cannot swim any more and begin to sink.   

## Heal (Wis)  
A Heal check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.  

_First Aid (standard action, DC 15)_: An adjacent dying character is stabilised. A stable character stops making death saves.  

_Additional Saving Throw (DC 15):_ A successful Heal check allows an adjacent ally to either (their choice) make a new saving throw right away or take a +2 bonus on a saving throw of their choice at the end of their next turn.   

_Treat Wound (standard action, DC 10)_: A successful Heal check allows an adjacent ally to use their second wind without spending a standard action. They don't get the standard bonus to defense if they choose to use it this way.   

_Treat Disease_: To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time the character makes an Endure or other check against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or their check result, whichever is higher.  

## History (Int)  
Your History check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.  

## Insight (Wis)  
Your Insight check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.  

## Intimidate (Cha)  
When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make an Intimidate check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.  

The Deter and Unnerve actions use the Intimidate skill (see the Rulebook for more details).

## Nature (Wis)  
Your Nature check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.  

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the GM might call for a Nature check. You also make a Nature check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.  

The GM might ask you to make a Nature check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.  

### Wilderness Hunting and Foraging  
Hunting and foraging takes one hour. On a successful check against DC 15, you find a day's worth of food and water for one creature. DC 25, you find a day's worth of food and water for five creatures.    

If you fail, you cannot attempt the check again for 24 hours.   

### Soothe Beast  

To calm or soothe a natural beast, for example so you can ride it or because it has been startled, make a Nature check (hard DC, use the creature's level to calculate DC).  

### Teach an Animal a Trick  

You can teach a natural beast a specific trick, like attack, come, defend, down, fetch, guard, heel, perform, seek, stay, track or work. This may take an extended challenge to complete.   

## Perception (Wis)  
Your Perception check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.  

### Notice  

Most of the time, whether you notice something will be determined by the GM rolling against your passive Perception score. When you deliberately turn your attention to something, you can take a swift action to see if you notice something.   

### Search  

When you spend a minute or more searching an area, you can cover a 3 square by 3 square space.   

### Notice Hiding Creature  

Make an opposed Perception vs Stealth check. On a success, you know where they are and, unless they are hidden from you for some other reason (e.g. they are invisible), you can see them.   

## Religion (Int)  
Your Religion check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.  

## Sleight of Hand (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)  

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Sleight of Hand check. The GM might also call for a Sleight of Hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.  

### Disable Device  

Make a Sleight of Hand check as a standard action.   

If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it.   

### Open Lock  

Opening a lock is a standard action.   

### Pick Pockets  

If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a Sleight of Hand check against a hard DC (target's level, not player character's) to obtain it.   

If the check succeeds, you get the item. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but are not caught. If you fail by 5 or more, you have failed and the target catches you doing it.   

An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.  

## Stealth (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)  
Make a Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.  

### Hiding  
You can hide at the end of any action where you moved.   

When you try to hide, make a Stealth check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Perception check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.  

You must have superior cover or total concealment to hide from a target.   

An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.  

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you attack a creature or come out of hiding and approach a creature, it sees you at the end of that action. This means you still get combat advantage on that action.   

***Movement:*** If you moved 3 squares or more, take a -5 penalty on the check to hide. If you took the Dash action, take a -10 penalty instead.   

While hidden, if you move 3 squares or more, you must make another Stealth check vs passive Perception score with a -5 penalty (-10 if running).   

***Passive Perception:*** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Stealth check with that creature's passive Perception score (see Passive skills, above).   

## Streetsmarts (Cha)  

You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement.  

# Feats

# Equipment  

First-level characters begin with 100 gold pieces to spend. Assume a character owns at least one outfit of normal clothes.  

Characters at higher levels start with one permanent magic item of their level +1, one permanent magic item of their level, one permanent magic item of their level -1, and gold pieces equivalent to the cost of a magic item of their level -1.  

## Coinage  

Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).  

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.  

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day or a night's rest in a poor inn.  

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars.   

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The platinum piece (pp) originates from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. A platinum piece is worth one hundred gold pieces.  

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.  

**Table - Exchange Rates**  

| Coin          | CP     | SP    | GP    | PP       |  
| ------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | -------- |  
| Copper (cp)   | 1      | 1/10  | 1/100 | 1/10,000 |  
| Silver (sp)   | 10     | 1     | 1/10  | 1/1,000  |  
| Gold (gp)     | 100    | 10    | 1     | 1/100    |  
| Platinum (pp) | 10,000 | 1,000 | 100   | 1        |  

## Selling Treasure  

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.  

***Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment:*** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch one-fifth their cost when sold in a market.  

***Magic Items:*** As a general rule, magic items fetch one-fifth their cost when sold in a market.  

***Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects:*** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.  

***Trade Goods:*** On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods - bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on - retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.  

## Armor  

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from cloth (lightly padded armor or regular clothing) to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into two categories: light armor and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.  

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.  

***Armor Proficiency:*** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Reflex defense.   

***Armor Class (AC):*** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.  

***Heavy Armor:*** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. Do not add an ability modifier to your Armor Class while wearing heavy armor.   

***Armor Check Penalty:*** If the Armor table shows "ACP", the wearer suffers that penalty to skills that identify that they come with an Armor Check Penalty.  

***Shields:*** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand.   

You can benefit from only one shield at a time.  

Light shields are strapped to your arm, you can still use your hand (e.g. to hold things or climb, but not to wield a weapon). Heavy shields are strapped to your arm and held in your hand, so you cannot use your hand for anything else.   

A shield's bonus applies to Armor Class and Reflex defenses.   

### Light Armor  

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  

***Cloth:*** Cloth armor is padded armor, or just regular clothes or a robe.   

***Leather:*** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.  

***Hide:*** This armor consists of thick furs and pelts.   

### Heavy Armor  

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.  

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Intelligence or Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.  

***Chain Mail:*** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows.   

***Scale:*** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish.   

***Plate:*** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

## Weapons  

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's approach and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.  

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess.   

Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is typically used to attack a target in an adjacent square to you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance. Some melee weapons, called **thrown weapons**, can be used at a range. Other melee weapons, called **reach weapons**, are still held in the hands for an attack but can attack creatures further away than just adjacent squares.   

### Weapon Proficiency  

Your ancestry, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The three categories are **simple**, **martial** and **exotic**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Typically, proficiency in an exotic weapon only comes with specialized training.   

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add the weapon's proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add the proficiency bonus to the attack roll.  

### Weapon Groups  

A weapon group describes the category that a weapon belongs to. Handaxes, battleaxes and greataxes all belong to the Axes category, for example.   

Weapon group has no rules of its own, but other powers and features might depend on the player character using a weapon from a particular group.   

- Axes  
- Bows  
- Crossbows  
- Slings  
- Maces and Clubs  
- Light Blades  
- Spears and Lances  
- Staffs  
- Heavy Blades  
- Picks and Hammers  
- Polearms  
- Flails and Chains  
  
### Weapon Properties  

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.  

***Execution #:*** Reroll damage die results of # or lower. For example, if you roll 2d6 with an execution 1 weapon, reroll any d6s that come up 1 until they come up a different number.   

***Improved Critical:*** *Level 1:* +1dW damage on a critical hit. *Level 11:* +2dW damage on a critical hit. *Level 21:* +3dW damage on a critical hit.   

***Loading:*** You can use a weapon that requires loading with ammunition to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container takes either a free or swift action, as specified in the table. At the end of the encounter, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.  

> **Loading (free):** It takes two hands to reload this weapon.  
>  
> **Loading (swift):** It takes two hands to reload this weapon. Because of the time required to load this weapon, after making a basic attack or attack power with this weapon, you must spend a swift action before attacking with it again.  

***Range:*** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have a -2 penalty on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.  

***Reach:*** This weapon adds 1 square to your reach when you attack with it. You can only flank or opportunity attack adjacent enemies, however.  

***Thrown:*** You can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.  

> **Thrown (light):** Use Dexterity for attack and damage rolls when you make a basic ranged attack with a heavy thrown weapon.   
>  
> **Thrown (heavy):** Use Strength instead of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls when you make a basic ranged attack with a heavy thrown weapon.   

***Two-Handed:*** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.  

***Side Weapon:*** You can hold a side weapon in your off hand. You can wield a one-handed weapon in one hand and a side weapon in your other. Each time you make a weapon attack (including a weapon power), you choose which weapon you attack with.   

***Small:*** Small characters cannot use a two-handed weapon unless it also has the Small property.  

#### Silvered Weapons  

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon, 10 crossbow bolts, 20 sling bullets or 30 arrows for 500 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.  

#### Improvised Weapons  

An improvised weapon, including an unarmed strike, does 1d4 damage (one-handed) or 1d8 damage (two-handed), with no proficiency bonus on the attack.   

### Designing Your Own Weapons  

Only a small selection of weapons are presented.    

However, you can design your own melee weapons by selecting one of the generic options in square brackets, and assigning a Weapon Group to them.  

Certain weapons get an additional property or benefit based on their Group (if [group] is written under Properties):   

* **Maces and Clubs; Spears and Lances; Staffs:** Weapon die increases by one (see Increased Weapon Die table below).   
* **Spears and Lances:** Weapon die increases by one (see Increased Weapon Die table below).   
* **Light Blades:** Proficiency bonus increases by +1.  
* **Heavy Blades:** Proficiency bonus increases by +1.   
* **Axes:** Execution 1.  
* **Picks and Hammers; Flails and Chains:** Improved Critical.   
  

You can design an exotic melee weapon by taking a martial weapon and adding another Group to it, along with the Group-based benefit or property listed above. For example, a khopesh could be a one-handed weapon in the Heavy Blades and Axes Groups, making it a proficiency +3, damage 1d8, Execution 1 weapon.   

You can design an exotic ranged weapon by taking a martial weapon and increasing either its proficiency bonus by +1 or its damage die by one step.   

**Table - Increased Weapon Die**  

| Die         | Increases to |  
| ----------- | ------------ |  
| 1d4         | 1d6          |  
| 1d6         | 1d8          |  
| 1d8         | 2d4 or 1d10  |  
| 2d4 or 1d10 | 2d6 or 1d12  |

#### Exotic Weapons  

Only a small number of special exotic weapons are presented here.   

***Garrote:*** A simple wire, when used properly, can disable or kill an opponent in seconds.   

*Requirement:* You can only use a garrote against a target granting you combat advantage which is not aware of you. You can only use the garrote with a melee basic attack or specific powers which utilize the garrote.  

*Property:* When you hit with a garrote, you grapple the target. The target cannot speak while grappled. The target is dazed while the grapple is in effect. The target also suffers a -2 penalty to escape attempts.  

**Table - Exotic Weapons**  

| Name    | Range | Type   | Hand | Proficiency Bonus | Damage (dW) | Range | Cost (gp) | Weight (lb) | Buffs             | Group   |  
| ------- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ----------------- | ----------- | ----- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------- |

## Focuses  

Most arcane, divine and natural powers, and some martial powers, have the Focus tag, meaning that they benefit from a magic focus if you use one while you use the power. Each power can only benefit from one magic focus at most.  

***Arcane Focus:*** An arcane focus is a special item - typically an orb, rod, staff, wand or book, although a crystal or a pouch of spell components would also be thematically appropriate - designed to channel the power of arcane spells.  

A quarterstaff can be used as both an arcane focus and a weapon.  

Unless otherwise mentioned, arcane focuses require a hand to use.  

***Druidic Focus:*** A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.  

Unless otherwise mentioned, druidic focuses require a hand to use.  

***Holy Symbol:*** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic.  

Unless otherwise mentioned, a holy symbol does not require a hand to use. It is enough that you have it on your person (perhaps emblazoned on a shield or hung around your neck).  

***Martial Focus:*** A martial focus is an item that inspires or reminds when seen or studied. It might be a short scroll describing a meditation that sharpens the mind for battle, or a book of strategies that can be reviewed quickly before bed, or a blunt sword that can be practiced with, or bindings wrapped around your hands while bareknuckle boxing, or a banner you carry on your back.   

Unless otherwise mentioned, a martial focus does not require a hand to use. It is enough that you have it on your person.  

## Adventuring Gear

***Rations:*** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

***Sunrod:*** This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates (bright light) a 20-square radius. It glows for 4 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.

## Mounts and Vehicles  

A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.

# Magic Items  

Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item's description gives the item's name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties.  

## Magic Items on the Body  

Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It’s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as 10 magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.  

A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups (two items from the ring group), keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.  

-   One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the ***head***  
-   One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the ***neck***, or one cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor)   
-   One robe or suit of ***armor*** on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)  
-   One belt around the ***waist*** (over a robe or suit of armor)  
-   One shield, pair of bracers or set of bracelets on the ***arms*** or wrists  
-   One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the ***hands***  
-   One ***ring*** on each hand (or two rings on one hand)  
-   One pair of boots or shoes on the ***feet***  

Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those listed above have no effect.  

Wondrous items can be worn or carried without taking up space on a character’s body.  

## Distributing Magic Items  

GMs can decide for themselves how to distribute magic items in their games, but for a balanced game there are three options.  

### 1. Steady Progression  

A player character should get a new permanent magic item every 12 encounters or so, and that item should be of a level equal to their own level +1 to +4 (roughly 25% chance of each). Since there are roughly 10 encounters to a level, other ways of thinking about this are that:  

1. each level a player character should get 0.8 of a permanent item *or*   
2. each level, a five-adventurer team should get four permanent items *or*  
3. over the course of five levels, a player character should get four permanent magic items.   

In addition, a player character should get gold pieces, trade goods, precious items, consumable magic items and so on equivalent in value to a permanent magic item of their level roughly every 25 encounters or so. Another way of saying that is that every level a player character should get 0.4 of a permanent item in gold pieces, etc.  

Keep in mind that a consumable magic item costs 1/25th as much as a permanent magic item of the same level.   

Assuming a rate of 10 encounters per level, that results in the following average treasure per player character per level (not including permanent magic items).

### 2. Magic Item Only  

Each level, each character receives one magic item of level +2 or two magic items of level +0. They do not receive any other treasure.   

### 3. Treasure Troves  

Each level, the party should discover about 10 treasure troves of their level. Each treasure trove is randomly generated by rolling 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12 and 1d20, with each result helping to determine the contents of the treasure trove.   

**1d4:** This is the magic item level bonus, see 1d12 below.   

**1d6:** This is the coin multiplier, see 1d20 below.   

**1d8:** On a 5, 6 or 7, the trove contains a number of art objects, see 1d10 below. On an 8, it contains a gemstone. On any other result, it contains nothing. See the table below for the value of the art objects or gemstone by level.   

**1d10:** If the trove contains art objects, this is how many it contains.   

Add 1 to the d10 roll for every additional player character in the party beyond 5, and subtract 1 for every player character that the party is missing below 5 PCs (minimum 0).   

**1d12:** On a 6 or less, the trove contains a personal item or something of significance to the story or adventure but not of monetary value. For example, it could be a note with the evil faction's watchword scribbled on it, a key to a door deeper in the dungeon, the mayor's missing spectacles, a clue to the disappearances by the docks, or just a kobold's pet toad.   

On a 5, 6 or 7, the trove contains a consumable item of the party's level.   

On an 8 or higher, the trove contains a permanent magic item of the party's level plus the 1d4 result.   

Add 1 to the d12 roll for every additional player character in the party beyond 5, and subtract 1 for every player character that the party is missing below 5 PCs (minimum 0).   

**1d20:** On an 11 or more, the trove contains coins. Multiply the 1d6 result by the number of coins shown in the table below for the total number of coins in the trove.   

Add 2 to the d20 roll for every additional player character in the party beyond 5, and subtract 2 for every player character that the party is missing below 5 PCs.

## Enchanted Items  

There are four core types of magic item, called enchanted items:   

* Cloaks, which increase defenses. Can also take the form of amulets (either way, they are worn about the neck).  
* Weapons  
* Focuses  
* Armor  
  

A character may need both an enchanted focus and an enchanted weapon, if they are for example a cleric that casts spells using a holy symbol and makes attacks with a mace. A character may need two weapons, if they dual-wield or mix it up between ranged and melee. Otherwise, a character only needs either an enchanted weapon or an enchanted focus, not both.   

Enchanted items give an enhancement bonus - so a +1 enchanted cloak gives a +1 enhancement bonus to Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses, while a +3 enchanted sword gives a +3 enhancement bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls, and +3d6 damage on a weapon critical hit. +2 enchanted armor gives a +2 enhancement bonus to Armor Class, and a +6 enchanted focus gives a +6 enhancement bonus to spell attack and damage rolls, and +6d6 damage on a spell critical hit.   

### Boosted Enchanted Items  

Some enchanted items do nothing extra. However, others have been boosted. There are four tiers of boost: I through IV, which increase the level of the enchanted item by that amount. So, for example, a +1 sword is level 1, but a +1 sword (boost II) is level 3. A +3 sword is level 11, but a +3 sword (boost II) is level 13.

|-------|-----------------------------|

## Wondrous Items  

### Horseshoes of a Zephyr  

*Level 5*  

When these four iron horseshoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.  

### Horseshoes of Speed  

*Level 10*  

When these four iron horseshoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature's speed by 6.  

### Immovable Rod  

*Level 8*  

This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use a swift action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses a swift action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Athletics check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.  

### Instant Fortress  

*Level 25*  

You can use a standard action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.  

The fortress is a square tower, 4 squares on a side and 6 squares high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a swift action. It is immune to magical effects that would open it or make it easier to open.  

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.  

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance 15 to all other damage.   

### Necrosis Cube

*Level 7*

**Regenesis:** When you spend a recovery, you heal additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. *Level 11:* Your Wisdom modifier +2. *Level 21:* Your Wisdom modifier +5.  

**Sustenance**: You do not need to eat or drink while carrying the cube. You only need two hours sleep for a long rest. 

**Healing Light**: The *necrosis cube* can transform residual arcane energy into a regenerative burst. Once per encounter, as an immediate (react) action, triggered when a creature within 6 squares uses an arcane power, you can spend a recovery to heal up to your recovery value.  

### Portable Hole  

*Level 5*  

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  

You can use a standard action to unfold a *portable hole* and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the *portable hole* creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open *portable hole* can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  

You can use a standard action to close a *portable hole* by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Athletics check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 1 square of the *portable hole* or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed *portable hole* can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.  

Placing a *portable hole* inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag of holding*, *handy haversack*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 2 squares of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.  

### Folding Boat  

*Level 16*  

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.  

One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.  

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.  

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.  

The third command word causes the *folding boat* to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.
