# Ancestries

## Ancestry Traits

The description of each ancestry includes traits that are common to members of that ancestry. The following entries appear among the traits of most ancestries.

### Ability Score Increase(s)

Every ancestry increases one or more of a character's ability scores.

### Size

Characters of most ancestries are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few ancestries are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding two-handed weapons.

### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move.

### Languages

By virtue of your ancestry, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

## Dwarf
As a dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.

Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

Most dwarves believe firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend to have a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. 

### Dwarf Traits

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

***Ability Score Increases:***

#### Tough as Nails
**Encounter** **Swift Action**

## Elf

Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own.

Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. 

### High Elf Traits

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. Some high elves are haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. Others are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other ancestries.

As a halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well with others.

A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of their second century.

As a rule, halflings are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.

Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds.

### Human Traits

It's hard to make generalizations about humans.

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. 

Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Giant curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

***Ability Score Increases:*** 

* +2 to one ability score of your choice

***Size:*** Your size is Medium.

***Speed:*** Your base walking speed is 6 squares.

***Hardy Stock:*** +1 ancestry bonus to Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses. 

***Human Power:*** You have a third level 1 at-will attack power from your class. 

### Variant: True Grit

Instead of giving humans a third level 1 at-will attack power from their class, GMs may want to offer them the *true grit* power instead - especially if they are taking a class that does not have at-will attack powers. However, GMs should note that *true grit* is unusually powerful for an ancestry power and it overlaps with the wood elf's *elfshot* power.

***Human Power:*** You have the *true grit* power.

#### True Grit
**Encounter** **No Action**
**Human Utility Ancestry** 
**Self** **Trigger:** You fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll
**Effect:** Add a +4 ancestry bonus to the roll/throw.

## Dragonborn

Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil can be terrible villains.

Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. 

### Dragonborn Traits

Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.

***Ability Score Increases:***

## Gnome

Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

Gnomes may be sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors, or minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.

Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds.

## Half-Elf

Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.

Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.

## Variant: No Weapon Limitations for Small Characters

While officially Small characters are limited in which weapons they can use, this can be frustrating for players and is not very important for game balance. GMs may prefer to let Small characters use any weapon they like. 


# Skills

A skill check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for a skill check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

**Using Skills**: To make a skill check, roll:

**1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = +5 if you are trained in the skill + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)**

This roll works just like an attack roll - the higher the roll, the better. Either you’re trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you’re trying to beat another character’s check result.

**Ability Modifier**: The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill’s key ability (the ability associated with the skill’s use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.

**Miscellaneous Modifiers**: Miscellaneous modifiers include ancestry bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.

## Using Skills

When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well they do. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.

Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise they would fail.

## Skill Checks

A skill check takes into account a character’s training (skill training), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account their ancestry's knack for doing certain things (ancestry bonus) or what armor they are wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things.

To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character’s skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character’s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill’s key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including ancestry bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.

### Difficulty Class

Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.

**Table - Recommended Difficulty Classes by Level**

| Level | Easy | Moderate | Hard |
|-------|------|----------|------|
| 1     | 8    | 12       | 18   |
| 2     | 9    | 13       | 19   |

| 29    | 22   | 32       | 41   |
| 30    | 23   | 33       | 42   |

### Opposed Checks

An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.

### Trying Again

In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.

### Untrained Skill Checks

Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill they do not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn’t have a skill training bonus added. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill’s key ability, are applied to the check.

Certain uses of some skills are only available to someone who is trained in that skill.

### Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions

Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.

The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.

1.  Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.
2.  Give the skill user a –2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.
3.  Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.
4.  Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.

Conditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.

### Time and Skill Checks

Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions or move actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action. These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.

### Checks without Rolls

A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.

**Taking 10**: When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure - you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help.

**Ability Checks**: The normal take 10 rules apply for ability checks.

**Passive Checks**: A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and training in Perception, they have a passive Perception score of 17.

## Combining Skill Attempts

When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.

### Group Checks

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group check, everyone in the group makes the skill check (or, in rare cases, the ability check). If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a Nature group check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

### Aid Another

You can help another character achieve success on their skill or ability check by making the same kind of check in a cooperative effort. The DC is 10 + half the level of the ally you are aiding. If you succeed, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to their check. If you fail, the character you are helping gets a -1 penalty to their check. 

In many cases, a character’s help won’t be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.

In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can’t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn’t achieve alone.

## Ability Checks

Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you’re making an untrained skill check.

In some cases, what is needed is a straight test of one’s ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn’t make a height check to see who is taller, you don’t make a Strength check to see who is stronger.

## Extended Challenges

With most skill checks, a single die roll immediately determines whether or not a character succeeds. If a character wants to jump across a chasm or recall a specific piece of information, his success or failure is apparent after a single check.

For complicated and time-consuming tasks (such as disabling a very complex trap, crafting a powerful artifact or researching an obscure bit of knowledge), or at times when the Game Master wants to build tension and suspense, an extended challenge might be called for. An extended challenge is a series of interconnected skill checks, in which the player characters try to succeed on some number of checks before failing three checks, in order to achieve an objective. 

In such a case, a specific number of successful skill checks must be achieved to complete the task. The complexity of the task is reflected in the number of successful rolls required to complete the task, and the maximum number of failed rolls that can occur before the attempt fails. In most cases, one or two failed rolls does not mean that an extended challenge has failed, but if three failed rolls occur before the character makes the required number of successful rolls, the attempt fails. Although three failures is a common baseline, Game Masters are encouraged to change the number if the situation warrants it.

Extended challenges allow the Game Master to build suspense in critical situations, add tension to multiple-round tasks during combat, enhance special adventure-specific tasks, and resolve complex activities more quickly.

Succeeding or failing the challenge typically determines whether achieving the objective comes at a cost, not whether the objective is achieved. In some cases, each success represents progress towards the objective, and failing the challenge just means missing out on all the available progress. 

Every extended challenge has a level, which determines the check DCs (different skills may attract Easy, Moderate or Hard DCs as appropriate for that level). Usually the level is set to the level of the PCs. Typically group checks use the Easy DC, the first check with a particular skill uses the Moderate DC and subsequent checks with that skill use the Hard DC. 

Whether they succeed or fail, PCs earn the XP specified for the extended challenge, often equivalent to each PC defeating one standard monster of that level. 

All PCs should participate, but not necessarily by making skill checks. They can also Aid Another to assist an ally's check. A failed Aid Another check does not count as a failure. 

Some special rules may apply to a particular challenge, e.g.: 
* on a failed challenge, each PC loses a recovery 
* certain skills can only be attempted once or twice 
* use of an encounter or daily power can serve as a success by itself 
* use of a consumable item or payment of gold pieces can serve as a success by itself 
* the outcome depends on which specific skills were used 
* a successful check removes a failure instead of adding a success
* a successful check adds a bonus or reroll to another check instead of adding a success
* the challenge has multiple stages, with different checks and outcomes in each one 
* missing a check DC causes a complication rather than a failure that counts towards the three 
* the threshold is greater or fewer than three failures
* the challenge takes place during a combat (only 4-6 successes should be required in this case, replacing 1-2 standard monsters)

# Skill Descriptions 

This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes other than those noted here.

Here is the format for skill descriptions.

## Skill Name

The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.

**Key Ability**: The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check. 

**Example Uses**: Suggestions for how the skill can be used. 

**Trained Only**: If this notation is included for an example use, you must be trained in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used untrained. 

**Armor Check Penalty**: If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.

The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other types of information:

## Skills
* Acrobatics
* Arcana
* Athletics
* Bluff
* Diplomacy
* Dungeoneering 
* Endure
* Heal
* History
* Insight
* Intimidate
* Perception
* Religion
* Stealth
* Streetsmarts
* Sleight of Hand

### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities

Normally, a set ability modifier applies to all checks with a particular skill. For example, Athletics checks add your Strength modifier. 

In some situations, though, a different ability might reasonably apply. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a different modifier. 

### Contests
Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In contests like these, the outcome is determined by an opposed check.

An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher check modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.

### Knowledge
Five skills - Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Nature and Religion - can be used to test a character's knowledge about a particular topic. General knowledge should have an Easy DC, knowledge that is based on specialization in a field a Moderate DC and obscure, hidden or secret knowledge a Hard DC. 

#### Monster Knowledge

To test what you know about a monster, make a skill check against a Moderate DC (using the level of the monster, not the player character, to determine the DC). On a success, you learn: 

* name
* ancestry
* type
* tags
* standard temperament 

If you also beat the Hard DC, you also learn:
* its powers
* its resistances
* its vulnerabilities 

Which skill to use? 
* Use Arcana for elemental and fey creatures, and creatures with the construct or shadow tag.
* Use Dungeoneering for aberration creatures. 
* Use Religion for outsider creatures, and creatures with the undead tag.
* Use Nature for natural creatures.

## Acrobatics (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)
Acrobatics covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for an Acrobatics check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

### Balance
You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can’t move for the rest of the action. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface.

_Being Attacked while Balancing_: If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Acrobatics check against the same DC to remain standing.

### Escape Restraints

Your Acrobatics check is opposed by a DC based on the type of restraint. It takes five minutes, or a standard action if you take a -10 penalty on the check. If you fail the check, you can only try again if someone is in a position to assist you with Aid Another. 

### Escape a Grapple

See the Escape action. 

### Fall with Style (Trained Only)
Make an Acrobatics check while falling to reduce damage. You take less damage equal to half the Acrobatics check result (for example, if your result is 23, you take 11 less damage). If you take no damage, you land on your feet (i.e., not prone).

## Arcana (Int)
Your Arcana check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.

### Detect Magic (Trained Only)
You sense the presence of magic.

#### Identify Persistant Power

Make an Arcana check against a power you can see with the Conjuration, Summon or Zone tags (DC 15 + 1/2 power's level). On a success, you learn the power's name, tags and power source. On a failure, you must take a short rest before trying to identify that particular power again. 

#### Identify Magical Things

Make an Arcana check against an environmental magical effect or the results of an incantation (hard DC). On a success, you identify the name of the phenomenon, any tags or power source it might have, and its general purpose. If it is the result of an incantation, you learn the incantation's names and the basics of its effects. On a failure, you must take a long rest before trying to identify that particular thing again. 

#### Sense Magic

As a standard action, you attempt to sense the presence of magic within 5 + your level squares. 

For each magical thing in range: 

* If its level is your level -5 or less, you automatically learn its power source and location. 
* If its level is greater than your level -5, make an Arcana check (hard DC) to learn its power source and location. 

## Athletics (Str, Armor Check Penalty)
Athletics covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

### Climb
With a successful Athletics check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at half your normal speed. 

An Athletics check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.

Each square climbed costs one extra square of movement (so if you have a speed of 6, with a move action you can climb 3). 

Any time you take damage while climbing, make an Athletics check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.

_Catching Yourself When Falling_: It’s difficult to catch yourself while falling. Make an Athletics check (DC = wall’s DC + 5) to do so. 

### Escape a Grapple

See the Escape action. 

### Jump

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

***Long Jump:*** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of *squares* equal to the check result divided by 10 (standing long jump) or divided by 5 (if you move at least 2 squares immediately before the jump). If the jump is successful, you land in the square beyond the square you jumped over. 

Either way, each square you clear on the jump costs a square of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. If you clear at least one square, the vertical height of your jump is 2 feet + the number of squares you could clear. E.g. if your jump could clear a 4-square gap, the vertical height is 6 feet. 

***High Jump:*** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of *feet* equal to the check result divided by 10 (standing high jump) or divided by 5 (if you move at least 2 squares immediately before the jump). Either way, every five feet costs a square of movement. 

You can extend your arms a third of your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1-1/3 times your height.

### Swim
Make an Athletics check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed. If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you sink 1 square.

The DC for the Swim check depends on the water (calm, rough or stormy). 

## Bluff (Cha)
Your Bluff check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

### Feinting in Combat
You can also use Bluff as a standard action once per encounter to mislead an opponent in melee combat, giving you combat advantage until the end of your next turn. The DC is the target's passive Insight score. 

### Creating a Diversion to Hide
You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide once per encounter as a standard action. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Stealth check while people are aware of you. The DC is the target or targets' passive Insight score (you can target any creatures that can see you).

## Diplomacy (Cha)
When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Diplomacy check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring nations, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

## Dungeoneering (Wis)
Knowledge of aberrations, caverns, oozes and spelunking. 

### Subterranean Hunting and Foraging
Hunting and foraging takes one hour. On a successful check against DC 15, you find a day's worth of food and water for one creature. DC 25, you find a day's worth of food and water for five creatures. 

If you fail, you cannot attempt the check again for 24 hours. 

## Endure (Con, Armor Check Penalty)

Harsh conditions or long exertions do not easily tire you. The GM might call for an Endure check when you:

- March or labor for hours without rest
- Go without sleep
- Survive without food or water

### Swim for Long Periods
Each hour that you swim, you must make an Endurance check (use the DC of the Athletics check you've been using, +2 for every hour). If you fail, you cannot swim any more and begin to sink. 

## Heal (Wis)
A Heal check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

_First Aid (standard action, DC 15)_: An adjacent dying character is stabilised. A stable character stops making death saves.

_Additional Saving Throw (DC 15):_ A successful Heal check allows an adjacent ally to either (their choice) make a new saving throw right away or take a +2 bonus on a saving throw of their choice at the end of their next turn. 

_Treat Wound (standard action, DC 10)_: A successful Heal check allows an adjacent ally to use their second wind without spending a standard action. They don't get the standard bonus to defense if they choose to use it this way. 

_Treat Disease_: To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time the character makes an Endure or other check against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or their check result, whichever is higher.

## History (Int)
Your History check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

## Insight (Wis)
Your Insight check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

## Intimidate (Cha)
When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make an Intimidate check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

## Nature (Wis)
Your Nature check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the GM might call for a Nature check. You also make a Nature check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

The GM might ask you to make a Nature check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

### Wilderness Hunting and Foraging
Hunting and foraging takes one hour. On a successful check against DC 15, you find a day's worth of food and water for one creature. DC 25, you find a day's worth of food and water for five creatures.  

If you fail, you cannot attempt the check again for 24 hours. 

### Soothe Beast

To calm or soothe a natural beast, for example so you can ride it or because it has been startled, make a Nature check (hard DC, use the creature's level to calculate DC).

### Teach an Animal a Trick

You can teach a natural beast a specific trick, like attack, come, defend, down, fetch, guard, heel, perform, seek, stay, track or work. This may take an extended challenge to complete. 

## Perception (Wis)
Your Perception check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

### Notice

Most of the time, whether you notice something will be determined by the GM rolling against your passive Perception score. When you deliberately turn your attention to something, you can take a swift action to see if you notice something. 

### Search

When you spend a minute or more searching an area, you can cover a 3 square by 3 square space. 

### Notice Hiding Creature

Make an opposed Perception vs Stealth check. On a success, you know where they are and, unless they are hidden from you for some other reason (e.g. they are invisible), you can see them. 

## Religion (Int)
Your Religion check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

## Sleight of Hand (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Sleight of Hand check. The GM might also call for a Sleight of Hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

### Disable Device

Make a Sleight of Hand check as a standard action. 

If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. 

### Open Lock

Opening a lock is a standard action. 

### Pick Pockets

If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a Sleight of Hand check against a hard DC (target's level, not player character's) to obtain it. 

If the check succeeds, you get the item. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but are not caught. If you fail by 5 or more, you have failed and the target catches you doing it. 

An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.

## Stealth (Dex, Armor Check Penalty)
Make a Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

### Hiding
You can hide at the end of any action where you moved. 

When you try to hide, make a Stealth check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Perception check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

You must have superior cover or total concealment to hide from a target. 

An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you attack a creature or come out of hiding and approach a creature, it sees you at the end of that action. This means you still get combat advantage on that action. 

***Movement:*** If you moved 3 squares or more, take a -5 penalty on the check to hide. If you took the Dash action, take a -10 penalty instead. 

While hidden, if you move 3 squares or more, you must make another Stealth check vs passive Perception score with a -5 penalty (-10 if running). 

***Passive Perception:*** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Stealth check with that creature's passive Perception score (see Passive skills, above). 

## Streetsmarts (Cha)

You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement.

# Equipment

First-level characters begin with 100 gold pieces to spend. Assume a character owns at least one outfit of normal clothes.

Characters at higher levels start with one permanent magic item of their level +1, one permanent magic item of their level, one permanent magic item of their level -1, and gold pieces equivalent to the cost of a magic item of their level -1.

## Coinage

Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day or a night's rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. 

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The platinum piece (pp) originates from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. A platinum piece is worth one hundred gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

## Selling Treasure

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

***Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment:*** As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch one-fifth their cost when sold in a market.

***Magic Items:*** As a general rule, magic items fetch one-fifth their cost when sold in a market.

***Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects:*** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

***Trade Goods:*** On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods - bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on - retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

## Armor

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from cloth (lightly padded armor or regular clothing) to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into two categories: light armor and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

***Armor Proficiency:*** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Reflex defense. 

***Armor Class (AC):*** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

***Heavy Armor:*** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. Do not add an ability modifier to your Armor Class while wearing heavy armor. 

***Armor Check Penalty:*** If the Armor table shows "ACP", the wearer suffers that penalty to skills that identify that they come with an Armor Check Penalty.

***Shields:*** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. 

You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

Light shields are strapped to your arm, you can still use your hand (e.g. to hold things or climb, but not to wield a weapon). Heavy shields are strapped to your arm and held in your hand, so you cannot use your hand for anything else. 

A shield's bonus applies to Armor Class and Reflex defenses. 

### Light Armor

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

***Cloth:*** Cloth armor is padded armor, or just regular clothes or a robe. 

***Leather:*** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

***Hide:*** This armor consists of thick furs and pelts. 

### Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Intelligence or Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

***Chain Mail:*** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. 

***Scale:*** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. 

***Plate:*** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

**Table - Armor and Shields**

| Name          | Type  | Base AC | ACP  | Speed Penalty | Cost | Weight |
| ------------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ------------- | ---- | ------ |
| Cloth armor   | Light | 10      |      |               | 1    | 4 lb.  |
| Leather armor | Light | 12      |      |               | 25   | 15 lb. |
| Hide armor    | Light | 13      | -1   |               | 30   | 25 lb. |
| Chainmail     | Heavy | 16      | -1   | -1            | 40   | 40 lb. |
| Scale armor   | Heavy | 17      |      | -1            | 45   | 45 lb. |
| Plate armor   | Heavy | 18      | -2   | -1            | 50   | 50 lb. |

| Name         | Type   | Shield Bonus | ACP  | Speed Penalty | Cost  | Weight |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ---- | ------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Light shield | Shield | +1           |      |               | 5 gp  | 6 lb.  |
| Heavy shield | Shield | +2           | -2   |               | 10 gp | 15 lb. |

## Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's approach and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. 

Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is typically used to attack a target in an adjacent square to you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance. Some melee weapons, called **thrown weapons**, can be used at a range. Other melee weapons, called **reach weapons**, are still held in the hands for an attack but can attack creatures further away than just adjacent squares. 

### Weapon Proficiency

Your ancestry, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The three categories are **simple**, **martial** and **exotic**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Typically, proficiency in an exotic weapon only comes with specialized training. 

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add the weapon's proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add the proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### Weapon Groups

A weapon group describes the category that a weapon belongs to. Handaxes, battleaxes and greataxes all belong to the Axes category, for example. 

Weapon group has no rules of its own, but other powers and features might depend on the player character using a weapon from a particular group. 

- Axes
- Bows
- Crossbows
- Slings
- Maces and Clubs
- Light Blades
- Spears and Lances
- Staffs
- Heavy Blades
- Picks and Hammers
- Polearms
- Flails and Chains

### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

***Improved Critical:*** *Level 1:* +1dW damage on a critical hit. *Level 11:* +2dW damage on a critical hit. *Level 21:* +3dW damage on a critical hit. 

***Loading:*** You can use a weapon that requires loading with ammunition to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container takes either a free or swift action, as specified in the table. At the end of the encounter, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

> ***Loading (free):*** It takes two hands to reload this weapon.
>
> ***Loading (swift):*** It takes two hands to reload this weapon. Because of the time required to load this weapon, after making a basic attack or attack power with this weapon, you must spend a swift action before attacking with it again.

***Range:*** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have a -2 penalty on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

***Reach:*** This weapon adds 1 square to your reach when you attack with it. You can only flank or opportunity attack adjacent enemies, however.

***Thrown (Light):*** You can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

***Thrown (Heavy):*** You can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. Use Strength instead of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls when you make a basic ranged attack with a heavy thrown weapon. 

***Two-Handed:*** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

***Bastard:*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. Do +1 damage when you wield a bastard weapon in two hands.

***Side Weapon:*** You can hold a side weapon in your off hand. You can wield a one-handed weapon in one hand and a side weapon in your other. Each time you make a weapon attack (including a weapon power), you choose which weapon you attack with. 

***Small:*** Small characters cannot use a two-handed weapon unless it also has the Small property. Small characters can use bastard weapons, but must wield them in two hands (and do not get the +1 damage bonus). 

#### Silvered Weapons

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon, 10 crossbow bolts, 20 sling bullets or 30 arrows for 500 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

#### Improvised Weapons

An improvised weapon, including an unarmed strike, does 1d4 damage (one-handed) or 1d8 damage (two-handed), with no proficiency bonus on the attack. 

### Exotic Weapons

At the moment, no particular exotic weapons are presented. If you take the Weapon Proficiency feat and would like to select an exotic weapon, work with your GM to design one. A simple rule of thumb to create an exotic weapon is to take a martial weapon and add either +1 to the proficiency bonus (maximum +3) **or** +2 to the damage die size (so a 1d6 damage weapon becomes a 1d8 damage weapon). 

For example, you could create a bastard sword exotic weapon by taking the longsword and giving it a 1d10 damage die instead of a 1d8 damage die, or a compound longbow by taking the longbow and giving it a +3 proficiency bonus instead of a +2 proficiency bonus.

## Focuses

Most arcane, divine and natural powers have the Focus tag, meaning that they benefit from a magic focus if you use one while you use the power. Each power can only benefit from one magic focus at most. 

***Arcane Focus:*** An arcane focus is a special item - typically an orb, rod, staff, wand or book, although a crystal or a pouch of spell components would also be thematically appropriate - designed to channel the power of arcane spells.

A quarterstaff can be used as both an arcane focus and a weapon.

Unless otherwise mentioned, arcane focuses require a hand to use.

***Druidic Focus:*** A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.

Unless otherwise mentioned, druidic focuses require a hand to use.

***Holy Symbol:*** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.

Unless otherwise mentioned, holy symbols do not require a hand to use. It is enough that you have it on your person (perhaps emblazoned on a shield or hung around your neck).

## Adventuring Gear

## Mounts and Vehicles

A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.

# Magic Items

Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item's description gives the item's name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties.

## Magic Items on the Body

Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It’s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as 10 magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.

A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups (two items from the ring group), keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.

-   One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the ***head***
-   One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab around the ***neck***, or one cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor) 
-   One robe or suit of ***armor*** on the body (over a vest, vestment, or shirt)
-   One belt around the ***waist*** (over a robe or suit of armor)
-   One shield, pair of bracers or set of bracelets on the ***arms*** or wrists
-   One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on the ***hands***
-   One ***ring*** on each hand (or two rings on one hand)
-   One pair of boots or shoes on the ***feet***

Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those listed above have no effect.

Wondrous items can be worn or carried without taking up space on a character’s body.

## Distributing Magic Items

GMs can decide for themselves how to distribute magic items in their games, but for a balanced game the rules can briefly be described as follows.

A player character should get a new permanent magic item every 12 encounters or so, and that item should be of a level equal to their own level +1 to +4 (roughly 25% chance of each). Since there are roughly 10 encounters to a level, another way of saying that is that each level a player character should get 0.8 of a permanent item, *or* that over the course of five levels, a player character should get four permanent magic items. 

In addition, a player character should get gold pieces, trade goods, precious items, consumable magic items and so on equivalent in value to a magic item of their level roughly every 25 encounters or so. Another way of saying that is that every level a player character should get 0.4 of a permanent item in gold pieces, etc.

Keep in mind that a consumable magic item costs 1/25th as much as a permanent magic item of the same level. 

Assuming a rate of 10 encounters per level, that results in the following average treasure per player character per level (not including permanent magic items). 

**Table - Magic Item Prices and Treasure per Encounter**

### Alternative Distribution Method

Each level, each character receives one magic item of level +2 or two magic items of level +0. They do not receive any other treasure. 

## Enchanted Items

There are four core types of magic item, called enchanted items: 

* Cloaks, which increase defenses. Can also take the form of amulets (either way, they are worn about the neck).
* Weapons
* Focuses
* Armor

A character may need both an enchanted focus and an enchanted weapon, if they are for example a cleric that casts spells using a holy symbol and makes attacks with a mace. A character may need two weapons, if they dual-wield or mix it up between ranged and melee. Otherwise, a character only needs either an enchanted weapon or an enchanted focus, not both. 

Enchanted items give an enhancement bonus - so a +1 enchanted cloak gives a +1 enhancement bonus to Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses, while a +3 enchanted sword gives a +3 enhancement bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls, and +3d6 damage on a weapon critical hit. +2 enchanted armor gives a +2 enhancement bonus to Armor Class, and a +6 enchanted focus gives a +6 enhancement bonus to spell attack and damage rolls, and +6d6 damage on a spell critical hit. 

### Boosted Enchanted Items

Some enchanted items do nothing extra. However, others have been boosted. There are four tiers of boost: I through IV, which increase the level of the enchanted item by that amount. So, for example, a +1 sword is level 1, but a +1 sword (boost II) is level 3. A +3 sword is level 11, but a +3 sword (boost II) is level 13.

On a successful check, it is as if you successfully performed the *plane walk* incantation. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.

### Amulet of Shielding (II)

While wearing this amulet, you have resistance to force damage, equal to double the enhancement bonus (e.g. resistance to force 6 for +3 amulet). 

### Cape of the Mountebank (II)

Once per day, as a standard action, teleport up to 20 squares. 

When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.

### Cloak of Arachnida (IV)

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to poison damage, equal to double the enhancement bonus (resistance to poison 6 for +3 amulet). 
- You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.
- You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.

### Cloak of Displacement (III)

*Minimum Enchantment:* +3

While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, meaning attacks against you do not have combat advantage if they otherwise would. 

If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.

### Cloak of Elvenkind (II)

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Perception checks made to see you are at a -2 penalty and you have a +2 enhancement bonus on Stealth checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires a swift action.

### Cloak of the Bat (IV)

While wearing this cloak, you have a +2 enhancement bonus on Stealth checks. 

In an area of dim light or darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 8 squares. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.

### Cloak of the Manta Ray (I)

While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed of 12 squares. Pulling the hood up or down requires a swift action.

## Armor Boosts

### Adamantine Armor (IV)

*Can only be applied to heavy armors*; *Minimum Enchantment:* +4

This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

### Armor of Invulnerability (IV)

*Plate Armor only*; *Minimum Enchantment:* +4

You have resistance to untyped damage while you wear this armor, equal to double the enhancement bonus (resistance to untyped damage 6 for +3 armor). 

Additionally, once a day you can use a standard action to make yourself immune to untyped damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor.

### Armor of Resistance (I)

You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor, equal to double the enhancement bonus (resistance to fire 6 for *+3 armor of fire resistance*). The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.

### Demon Armor (II)

While wearing this armor, you can understand and speak Abyssal.

This armor's enhancement bonus also applies to your attack and damage rolls. 

Remember, enhancement bonuses do not stack, so this replaces your existing *enchanted weapon* if this bonus is higher. 

***Curse:*** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the *remove curse* incantation or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls against demons and to your defenses against their powers.

### Dragon Scale (III)

*Scale Armor only*

Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table), equal to double the enhancement bonus (resistance to fire 6 for *+3 red dragon scale armor*).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Table - Dragon Scale Mail**

| Dragon | Resistance |

### Glamored Leather (I)

As a swift action, speak the armor's command word. It assumes the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor.

### Ring of Mind Shielding

*Level 20*

While wearing this ring, other creatures cannot to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature ancestry or tags. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.

You can use a swift action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use another swift action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.

If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic communication.

### Ring of Regeneration

While wearing this ring, you regain 5 hit points every round, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.

### Boots of Jumping

Once an encounter, as a move action, fly up to your regular speed. 

## Wondrous Items

### Horseshoes of a Zephyr

*Level 5*

When these four iron horseshoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.

### Horseshoes of Speed

*Level 10*

When these four iron horseshoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature's speed by 6.

### Immovable Rod

*Level 8*

This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use a swift action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses a swift action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Athletics check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.

### Instant Fortress

*Level 25*

You can use a standard action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.

The fortress is a square tower, 4 squares on a side and 6 squares high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a swift action. It is immune to magical effects that would open it or make it easier to open.

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance 15 to all other damage. 

### Portable Hole

*Level 5*

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use a standard action to unfold a *portable hole* and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the *portable hole* creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open *portable hole* can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use a standard action to close a *portable hole* by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Athletics check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 1 square of the *portable hole* or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed *portable hole* can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a *portable hole* inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag of holding*, *handy haversack*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 2 squares of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

### Folding Boat

*Level 16*

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.

One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

The third command word causes the *folding boat* to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

# Appendices

## Appendix A: Powers Available by Level

The following table shows how many powers and of which levels a character is entitled to, based on the character's level. A character can always choose a lower-level power (of the same frequency, e.g. a level 3 encounter attack power instead of a level 7 encounter attack power) in place of a higher-level one.

"(P)" indicates that the power comes from a prestige path. "(E)" indicates that the power comes from an epic path.
