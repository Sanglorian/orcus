# The False Necromancer

Designed for four level 2 characters. *Five level 2/Four level 3:* Add one ostovite to each encounter. 

The residents of the remote town of Xolos are gripped with panic after the dead returned to life and terrorized the town. 

**Investigations**

* The gossipy baker Jeb: The local cleric of Yaheine, Yolande, has been thrown in jail by the lawman Spade for failing to repulse the shambling skeletons. 
* Spade's deputy Smithson: Spade suspects Yolande of raising the dead herself, and is planning to execute her come the end of the week. 
  * *Intimidate DC 13:* If questioned sternly, Smithson breaks down and reveals something Spade would rather kept secret. Since her arrest yesterday, Yolande spent a sleepless night praying to Yaheine. If she is a charlatan, she is a convincing one.   
* Aging scholar Zachariah Zibrek: Zachariah prevails on the heroes to investigate. He's sure there's something else going on, but lacks the courage and physical strength to investigate himself. 
  * Zachariah will be extremely grateful if the heroes can bring back an undamaged specimen for further investigation. They are not to prioritize this over securing the safety of the town, however! (500 XP if the heroes succeed.) 
  * *Arcana DC 9:* If prompted by a learned question, Zachariah admits he has read of creatures that appear to be one type but are another: demons that resemble golems, angel-winged fairies, and so on.  
* Farmer Sarah: Sarah spied the skeletons creeping through her fields, on their way into town. Her pumpkin farm lies between the town and the mausoleum. 
  * *Diplomacy DC 9:* If reassured by the heroes, Sarah feels comfortable volunteering something she was holding back: the skeletons looked more like strange animals built out of bone than they did properly-formed human skeletons. One seemed to have six legs, and another had hands made out of a pair of clattering lower jaws.   
* Mayor Cartwright: The mayor has no particular affections for Yolande, but is worried that executing her unduly will both fail to prevent the undead attacks and risk the wrath of Yaheine. She is prepared to pay 500 gold pieces if the heroes find what's happening and put a stop to it. She will let them take any amount in advance, in the form of minor magical items. 
  * *Bluff or Insight DC 9:* If the heroes pretend they are willing to walk, the mayor will go as high as 1,200 gold pieces. 

**For the Game Master:** Yolande is no charlatan. Her anti-undead magic has failed because the shambling skeletons are not undead. They are intricate mechanical puppets created and controlled by strange insects called ostovites. Jealous of the size and skeletons of larger creatures, ostovites use skeletons they find or "create" to build themselves chariots of bone.

**Mausoleum (500 XP):** At some point, the heroes will head to the mausoleum to investigate further. The upper level is a beautiful marble reception area, where the dead were lain in rest for their loved ones to file past. 

As if in hideous parody of human rites, two "skeletons" are lain in the sarcophagus on the dais. When they sense the approach of fresh meat, they stir. 

* 2 ostovites
* 2 bone chariots

**Undertaker's Cottage:** Behind the mausoleum is the undertaker's cottage. You find what remains of him: skin and flesh cut away from his bones, all of which are missing. However, before you feel too sympathetic - note that hidden under his bed is a chest filled with necklaces, rings, earrings and other treasures he stole from dead townsfolk before burial. This is 400 gold pieces worth of jewelry and a *+1 amulet of shielding*. 

**Down the Font (500 XP):** The water font has been hollowed out by thousands of scratches, creating a pit leading down into the catacombs below. When the heroes reach the first room, the ostovites attack. 

* 2 ostovites

* 2 bone chariots

**Staging Room (625 XP):** This large room contains four bone chariots, one in each corner. Their masks are up, to reveal that there is no ostovite inside. However, the bone chariots are under the control of a psychic ostovite, who is hidden beneath a pile of bones in a corner of the room (Perception DC X to spot). 

* 4 bone chariots

* 1 ostovite sentient

The sentient is wearing an (ill-fitting) *helm of intellect*. 

**Earthworks and beyond:** Beyond the carefully sealed catacombs is a rising earthen tunnel. Shards of bones litter the ground, as well as piles of rocks that have been pushed to the side of the earthworks. Echoing from the tunnel is the sound of scraping and falling earth. The heroes come across a bone chariot the size of a moose, scratching at the roof of the tunnel. As they arrive, a sliver of light appears and then, before their eyes, the massive bone chariot opens up a hole to above ground. With a flick of its tail (made of human spines), it climbs out. 

The mega-chariot is making its way to town. The heroes will have to stop it there to protect the townsfolk. 

**Back in town (750 XP):**

* 1 mega-chariot 

When the mega-chariot is destroyed, the ostovites swarm out to continue the fight as an ostovite swarm. 

Each round, the mega-chariot/ostovite swarm threatens a different civilian: Jeb, Smithson, Zachariah, Sarah or Mayor Cartwright. Successful skill checks or other interventions can protect the civilians (DC 9 for a good idea, DC 13 for a stretch).
