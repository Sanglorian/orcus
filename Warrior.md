### Bear and Wolf Styles  

When your hit points are high enough that you are not staggered, you have the Bear Style feature. While you are staggered, you lose Bear Style and gain the Wolf Style feature until you are healed enough that you are no longer Staggered.

*Bear Style:* Adjacent enemies suffer a -2 penalty to attacks that do not include you as a target, unless they have the marked condition.

*Wolf Style:* Once per round, you can do additional damage when you hit with an attack. *Level 1:* +1d8. *Level 11:* +2d8. *Level 21:* +3d8.  

### Warrior Powers  

As a warrior, you learn and use powers differently to other classes.  

You know all at-will powers in the Weapon Drill discipline, and can use them as normal at-will powers. These replace the two level 1 at-will attack powers that other heroes gain at level 1. 

At level 1, you can use the power *warrior’s surge* once per encounter. At level 3, twice per encounter. At level 5, three times per encounter. At level 13, four times per encounter. You do not learn other encounter or daily attack powers. 

You gain a class utility power at levels 2, 6, 10, 16 and 22. You can choose utility powers from any Martial discipline.

### Warrior Boons  

At level 5, you do +1 damage each time you hit with an attack. At level 15, this increases to +2. At level 25, this increases to +3.

### Multiclassing, Kits and Other Power Swaps
